0,246,GuerillaBeam Beta,"This is the old GuerillaBeam projector base unit. GuerillaBeam is not a toy, but a weapon of mass distraction. ""the most powerful gun you are allowed to print""
Current versions: 
v.58 currently recommended standard version
v.57x same, but with a second accessory rail at the top
v.49e slightly older but most compact version
GuerillaBeam features:
brightness and portability
long runtime
great image quality (depending on lens and light)
short bill of materials, parts are very easy to come by
print your own slides
print your own projector and accessories
By purchasing the GuerillaBeam Beta now, you will also get the 1.0 release version (""GuerillaBeam One"") which I will publish here soon. 
Please notice that your purchase will be under CC BY-NC-SA license, meaning you are allowed to COPY, REMIX and SHARE it as you like, as long as you give credit and do it in a non-profit way.
HowTo:
First, find a suitable LED (flash)light.
the flashlight should ideally project a uniform spot of 45mm (the 35mm slide image area) at the distance to the slide (which is also around 45mm).
Look for Cree XM-L T6 lights with 1000 Lumen (this means two LIIon batteries). XM-L2 lights are even better
a good  and affordable light is the SomeFire X8 (for example UltraFire X8).
Second: you'll need reasonably bright SLR lens (f/2.8 or better). The brighter the better! For starters: just pick any 135mm or 50mm, just don't pay more than 23 bucks.
Third: print adapters for light and lens.
Fourth and final: Just attach lens and a light and project away! (more detailed directions can be found at http://guerillabeam.net)
As time allows and demand dictates, templates for accessories are and/or will be available too, like:
Adapter for M42 and T2 lenses
tripod mount / quick release plate
Adapters for Pentax, Canon EF-S, Minolta, Rolleiflex and others (online soon)
Pistol grip with slide magazine
Flashlight adapters
flash adapter (planned soon)
slide on quick mount plates (online soon)
slide on NATO accessory rail (online soon)
Possibilities are endless, and my pipeline is currently full of ideas. You can also create your own extensions and variants of GuerillaBeam. I will publish all needed schematics. In case you need something specific you can just ask me. I also offer complete beamer sets for all purposes. 
Printing tips for printing with fused deposition modeling
I usually slice with Cura, and print on an Ultimaker Original (0.4mm nozzle) with ~60mm/s in PLA. I recommend 0.2mm layer height, 1.2 mm shells (3 walls) and 13% fill for reasonable printing times of around 4 hours. The base unit will hold lenses over 2kg without problems this way.
You can print usable projectors with 0.5mm nozzles and layer heights of up to 0.4mm, or at insane speeds, but you will have more cleanup work and worse ergonomics then
If you are interested in my current Cura profiles please drop me a line and I will put them online.",590,universalist

0,248,GuerillaBeam Flashlight adapters,"UPDATE 2015-05-03: Updated adapters, new flashlights
This set contains adapters for the following (recommended) Cree XM-L LED flashlights.
TrustFire X8 (most recommended)
UltraFire X8 (quite similar to the TrustFire X8)
TrustFire Z5
SkyRay King (caution: hot, can melt PLA!)
ThruNite TN 30 (brightest, but hot - can melt PLA)
'PedalBeam' bike light (advantage of DC plug, overheats, hot - can melt PLA)
The following prototpye adapters are only included for historical reasons (unsupported):
UltraFire C8 (cheap light, bad projections)
TrustFire TR-3T6 (very large, very hot)
TrustFire TR-J18 (very large, very hot)
These adapters are intended for the GuerillaBeam projector, but you could use them to attach those lights to whatever you like.
Most adapters work the same: They are slightly bent open, and snapped on the front of the flashlight (after removing the flashlight front bezel, if possible). Locking is done by screwing a GuerillaBeam (or a compatible nut) on them. The adapters for the TN30 and the SkyRay King are screwed into the lights instead of their original bezel ring.",590,universalist

Printing tips:
Print with the screw thread facing upwards. 1mm shell and 23% fill are usually enough. Layer heights up to 0.3mm are possible, recommended value: 0.2mm. Printed successfully on an Ultimaker with PLA.
Regarding M42:

0,286,Shogi iconified,"Shogi is one of the oldest variants of the game that we know as chess. It boasts some very cool mechanics like adding captured opponents to your army and piece promotion by flipping the pieces. However, traditional Shogi sets can scare away potential new players since you need to learn the Japanese characters for the pieces along with their moves.
This set solves both problems at once. Each piece has the name and an icon representing their moves. A blunt line from the sphere means that piece can move or capture one square in that direction. A pointed line from the sphere means that piece can move in as many unobstructed spaces as are available in that direction. The knight moves similar to it's counterpart in western Chess, except that it can only jump to the two spaces in front of it, and to one to the left and right, not the spaces sideways or backwards. Then when you get to the 7th rank flip the piece over to promote it and it's new movement is shown.

For greatest effect change filament colors at regular intervals. Change the deluxe board every 6mm, change the card board every 2mm. Start with light green or yellow for the Plains of Kashe, then gray for the Silver City, then dark green for the Forests of Coindor, then tan or brown for the Copper Peaks and finally white for the peaks of the mountains.

Each coin has unique elements to distinguish it. The coins are sized similarly sized to pocket change, ranging in size from quarter to dime, and are slightly thicker than traiditional coins (3mm thick) to make them easier to handle as tokens. Of course scaling is always an option (though the surface details may suffer if made too thin). One side has traditional numerals on it, the other side has roman numerals, but pausing the print and changing filament at the 50% mark to a different color is a way to make the sides even more distinctive.",669,joealarso

The headsman moves and captures in the same manner as a king though counts as a pawn for all intents and purposes. When a player makes a capture with their headsman, the captured piece's head may be swapped onto any piece adjacent to the headsman (after the capture move has been made) transforming the adjacent piece (friend or foe) into the type that was captured. The headsman may itself be captured and have its head transferred in this manner as well.

We may have met the goal, but anything over that just means we get to make more books, and not much would make the gang at IGG happier.
Also, if you're into bizarre, stream of consciousness nerdery, we just launched our Lost Agency Archives podcast, wherein we at Ill Gotten Games record our gaming sessions.

NAME: Jools Calixa SPECIES: Human (Clone) ORIGIN: Zyntradi Commonwealth
Heiress to the Calixa fortune, Jools was gifted with the brane ship, Castellan, on her 18th name day. Along with her android companion, Solver, and a minimal crew employed to her house, Jools forged off into the Multiverse. Since then, Jools and Solver have seen and experienced things that most beings only dream of. Using Nexus City as her home point, Jools often returns to refuel and resupply before heading back out to parts unknown.

The Awadi (Kaldro's species) are an intelligent, though extremely slow species that evolved peacefully on the paradise-world of Khapia 7. They were created using the Wayfarer random alien tables (the unedited beta can be found here: https://pinshape.com/items/362-3d-printed-wayfarer... ) and Kaldro himself was a random creation (as are many of the characters for our Lost Agency games).

NAME: Yarp SPECIES: Iolosian Mantle Crab ORIGIN: Mooncliffs of Iolos
Arguably a non-sapient species, Iolosian Mantle Crabs such as Yarp are often employed as pack mules by adventurers forging into inhospitable territories. Left alone, Mantle Crabs are content living peacefully in the cliff-side tunnels they call home. However, once trained, Mantle Crabs often bond to their owners, even protecting them against perceived threats.

0,379,Odinn's Dice,"Description
From the fantastic Heroine's Quest: The Herald of Ragnarok, an RPG/adventure game hybrid from Crystal Shard.
http://www.crystalshard.net/hq.htm
http://www.crystalshard.net/index.php
This is one of the best AGS (Adventure Games Studio) games I've ever played, and their attention to Norse myth really won me over. If you played the old Sierra Hero's Quest games, I guarantee you'll love this. The game is 100% free, and a real labor of love for those who made it. You can get it on their site and on Steam, and if you liked it as much as I did, support them with a donation on PayPal.
This simple dice game is featured within Heroine's Quest and I pretty much immediately decided that I needed a physical version. There's no better way to weather the Fimbulwinter than to hole up with some mead and roll some dice for 3D printed gold. The rules are pretty simple, so here goes:
----THE RULES----
As near as I can tell, the game can support upwards of two players. Each player has 3 dice and a stack of coins (print a bunch if you're feeling wealthy). To start the game, all players place their arms on the table (in a manly, viking fashion) and roll the dice so they are obscured from the other players. Starting with the first player (decide who that is somehow... probably via feats of strength or pain resistance) each player takes a turn.
During a turn, you may bet a coin (placing it into a pile in the center of the table), bet two coins and and re-roll any selection of dice, or put two coins in and call (forcing all others to do so at that moment). Once you have chosen to call, the dice are revealed and the winner is decided.
----Scoring-----
The following combinations of rolls are ranked from best to worst. In the case of a tie, roll off with all of your dice until one viking...er, I mean player has won:
3 Ravens (Odinn)
3 Hammers (Thor)
3 Runes (Asgard)
1 of each (Midgard)
From there, Ravens are worth more than Hammers, which are worth more than Runes, which are worth more than Blanks. You get the picture. The winner takes the pot and is congratulated for being the brawniest or something, and, should coins remain, the game continues.
The base dice are 20mm (which is huge, chunky, and good for jotun and/or trolls) though I've included 16mm and 12mm versions which should be better for our puny human hands.
Enjoy!

We'll be updating the progress of the game and provide expanded rules on our blog, so be sure and check us out there as well
http://illgottengames.blogspot.com/
All of the pieces were designed using Tinkercad.
https://tinkercad.com/users/bHIdLANxoGl-arian-crof...
Instructions
Each piece was printed on my Makerbot Replicator at a .10 layer height with 10% infill. I printed them all one piece at a time, though you can feel free to try and print bricks of them. I had trouble doing so and it was probably due to my calibration. All in all, the set takes about 9 hours to print, give or take.
Rules
So, for the core set as I've designed it, you'll need the following (and I've included the colors you should paint things, though this is only a suggestion):
-3 Conscripts (tan)
-2 Archers (tan)
-2 Spearmen (tan)
-2 Swordsmen (tan)
-1 Shieldmaiden (tan)
-1 Fire Mage (tan)
-3 Beastfolk Stalkers (dark green)
-2 Beastfolk Marauders (dark green)
-2 Beastfolk Juggernauts (dark green)
-2 Forest Witches (dark green)
-1 Cursed Ranger (dark green)
-1 Druid (dark green)
-1 Caer (tan)
-1 Druid's Circle (dark green)
-2 Village Tiles (tan)
-3 Water Tiles (blue)
-4 Hills Tiles (light green)
-4 Field Tiles (yellow)
-7 Forest Tiles (dark green)
You'll also need a grip of six-sided dice (6 for each player) and it helps immensely if half of them are a different color. The rules are in super-beta mode (just finished writing them last night) so expect typos and confusion, but throw me some feedback and I can answer questions/clean up the document as we go.

Born to powerful wizard ruling over the Godborn Isles, Iolanda was schooled in the ways of magic from an early age. Possessed of an inquisitive mind, Iolanda spent much of her youth delving deeply into forbidden magics found in the ruins scattered throughout the islands of her father’s realm. After finding an ancient and powerful spell capable of tearing a hole in the fabric of space, Iolanda, heedless of the warnings of her peers, entered the mysterious rift. After a harrowing journey through the Multiverse, Iolanda found herself in Nexus City where she was taken in by the Academy of Arcane Studies. Within several years, Iolanda became one of the highest ranking Blue Mages within the institution. Her mastery of summoning and mixing of spells and natural chemistry has earned her high honors with the Arch Magi and, there are rumors that she is being groomed to enter their ranks when a seat becomes vacant.

-3 Shambling Corpses (purple) -2 Shrouded Vassals (purple) -2 Dread Riders (purple) -2 Barrow Guards (purple) -1 Barrow Lord (purple) -1 Necromancer (purple)
-1 Temple of Light (White) -1 Fallen Caer (Purple) -5 Village Tiles (tan) -4 Water Tiles (blue) -7 Hill Tiles (light green) -4 Ruin Tiles (Purple)
You'll also need a grip of six-sided dice (6 for each player) and it helps immensely if half of them are a different color. The rules are in super-beta mode (just finished writing them last night) so expect typos and confusion, but throw me some feedback and I can answer questions/clean up the document as we go. I'd definitely expect some of these abilities to change, but hey, who knows? ;-)",1031,utchmogul

NAME: Solver (Unit H-42B) SPECIES: Model-7 Android ORIGIN: Innovation (Circle-Tech HQ)
One of a secretly produced run of sapient robots built from schematics stolen from the late Dr. Harlan Smythe, Unit H42-B was gifted to Jules Calixa, heiress to the Calixa fortune and major Circle-Tech shareholder. Though designed as a companion unit, Jules found many uses for the android, nicknaming him “Solver” as his penchant for rapid-learning resulted in the acquisition of many useful skills, including the operation and repair of Jules’ Brane-Ship, the Castellan. As his mistress’ affections for him grew stronger, so to did Solver’s bond and desire to protect her. Against Circle-Tech’s advice, Jules had many of Solver’s control sub-systems removed, leaving only the protocol that binds him to her service, adding a caveat that the program will deactivate in the event of her death, leaving Solver free to walk his own path.

Introducing Pocket-Tactics! 
A fast-paced, modular strategy board game that all fits in a tiny bag. Still not sure what we'll do with this little game, though I'd like to make it free to print and play to my fellow makers. My nerdsmen and I have been having a blast with it these last few days. If anyone ends up printing one of these let me know how it plays, I'd love to get some feedback. Reporting any typos/mistakes in the rules would be greatly appreciated as well. We'll be updating the progress of the game and provide expanded rules on our blog, so be sure and check us out there as well http://illgottengames.blogspot.com/ All of the pieces were designed using Tinkercad. http://illgottengames.blogspot.com/
Instructions 
Each piece was printed on my Makerbot Replicator at a .10 layer height with 10% infill. I printed them all one piece at a time, though you can feel free to try and print bricks of them. I had trouble doing so and it was probably due to my calibration. All in all, the set takes about 9 hours to print, give or take. So, for the core set as I've designed it, you'll need the following (and I've included the colors you should paint things, though this is only a suggestion): -3 Conscripts (tan) -2 Archers (tan) -2 Spearmen (tan) -2 Swordsmen (tan) -1 Shieldmaiden (tan) -1 Fire Mage (tan) -3 Beastfolk Stalkers (dark green) -2 Beastfolk Marauders (dark green) -2 Beastfolk Juggernauts (dark green) -2 Forest Witches (dark green) -1 Cursed Ranger (dark green) -1 Druid (dark green) -1 Caer (tan) -1 Druid's Circle (dark green) -2 Village Tiles (tan) -3 Water Tiles (blue) -4 Hills Tiles (light green) -4 Field Tiles (yellow) -7 Forest Tiles (dark green) You'll also need a grip of six-sided dice (6 for each player) and it helps immensely if half of them are a different color.

0,493,PranceVichard Human Syndicate Enforcer,"NAME: Prance Vichard SPECIES: Human ORIGIN: Zyntradi Commonwealth 
Once an all-star Entropy Player on a proudly all-human team, Prance stubbornly refused to take a fall during an important match. In retaliation, Zero Syndicate goons ambushed him while he was celebrating and cut off his leg with mono-filament wire. Refusing to get back into the game and offer his opponents handicap points due to his cybernetics, Prance retired. After several years wallowing in anger, Prance found his pension running thin. Out of options, he hired himself as muscle to a local bookie. After his employer was murdered by Zero Syndicate goons, Prance was given the choice of either working for the syndicate or to join his employer in the Undercity maintenance chasms. Choosing the former, Prance now works for the very agency that took his dreams of being a legendary athlete. Biding his time, Prance does their bidding while he plots for revenge.

0,517,George R. R. Martin's Cyvasse (unofficial game),"This is my attempt to translate the chess-like game featured in George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire novels (Game of Thrones). Being a huge fan of the man and his work, I wanted to try and give his game the best translation I could. Working with my good friend (and studious Martin scholar) Nate Stephens, I adapted the game to include everything mentioned in the book into a rules set I found believable for a game made during the emulated time period, while also keeping the games in mind that Martin has mentioned as inspiration during interviews. So, Let me know if you get to printing/playing it, and if you have any suggestions for rules adjustments, variants, etc, post in the comments below and let's get a dialogue going. The rules PDF is with the other downloads, and its a light read (2 pages). Game on! 
Instructions 
With the current rules configurations, you'll need to print the following: Each side (Onyx and Alabaster) has Rabble x3, Spearmen x3, Crossbowmen x3, Light Horses x3, Heavy Horses x2, Elephants x2, Catapult x1, Trebuchet x1, Dragon x1, King x1, Keep x1 All of the pieces are grouped to reflect the distribution, so you only need to print each STL once. Of course, if you'e feeling brave, you can print the full plate, That has all the pieces one side will need. In addition, you'll need 6 mountains (three per player), four board sections (two per player), a pair of screen braces (both are in the same STL) and the two halves of the screen. I printed mine in black ABS and painted the pieces with acrylic model paints though the pieces would be great printed in black and white ABS, and wouldn't really require painting (that's just how I roll). I also painted the board in a checker-pattern. It wasn't necessary, but it makes movements (especially diagonal ones) a little easier to track.",1031,utchmogul
0,518,Forest Dragon,"As famine struck the dark forests of Jotunheim, Wolf-Eater scaled the impossible cliffs of Ymir's Brow, descending into the lowlands of Midgard and sating his hunger on the tribes of men. I wanted to make a proper Norse dragon. I really liked the idea of an antlered forest wyrm with vestigial wings adapted to climbing giant trees. Currently using this guy as the center of an RPG storyline. He's scaled to 15mm (making him rather massive) so he can be used with my Pocket-Tactics models, but he'd make a good dragon for heroic scale (25-30mm gaming) as well.

Sir fish is the sophisticated one of the bunch (or so he thinks), he grew up in the same pond as the others, but seems to have acquired an accent of a far off place he has never visited. Baby fish is the child that never grew up, though the same age as the others tends to be quiet, reserved and needs to be babied by the other fish.

0,713,TARDIS Run board game Print-In-One,"Updated 12/17/2015
Many of the Doctor's most feared opponents have teleported into the TARDIS to steal the last copy of the Black Scroll of Rassilon from the TARDIS library. With no one else who can help the Doctor's past regenerations have been gathered to protect the scroll. Whoever finds the Black Scroll and escapes first wins! TARDIS run is a game of luck and risk management inspired by Backgammon, Parchisi, and the Ancient Egyptian game Senet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqKEkfNf1fI
The board for this game is designed to fold into a neat carrying case that holds everything necessary to play inside. The board prints in one piece and pops off the build platform ready to fold and play, but a large build area is necessary. If a smaller build area is desired use the print-in-parts version of the game.
Rules are included in image and PDF form. Print the image at 300DPI or use the PDF, cut the rules out and fold in 4ths to fit in the board, assuming the scale was unchanged.
I find it is best to print the board with the charm so the light on top prints well. Plus you get a little charm when you're done. You can also choose to use any of the doctor or monster pawns you want from here:

Directions: The top should be printed as hollow as possible with no infill. You may need to print at a much, much slower print to avoid warping issues. The bottom should be printed at the highest density possible. The closer to 100% the better. The goal is to have the highest possible weight difference between the top and bottom pieces.

0,947,Troke classic board game and 3d printed board,"This re-imagining of the 1956 game, Troke, changes the simple cylinders of the original into detailed models and adds a 3D printed board with spaces for the pieces. A classic, out-of-print game is back! 3D printing is once again thumbing it's nose at scarcity.
From BGG http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1993/troke
""The sub-title for Troke is 'Castle Checkers'.
""Abstract strategy game where players move three different kinds of pieces (tower, wall, and moat) across a board diagonally forward, straight ahead or sideways, but never backwards. .... [I]t is a race to see who can get all their pieces to [the opposite] goal line. A feature of the game is that if you merge with one or two different pieces you take one or two extra moves. You are allowed to merge (capture) with opponent’s pieces and thus move them away from their goal and towards your own. Making moves becomes complicated as the game progresses because capturing pieces requires that additional moves be made. If these extra moves can not be made, then the original capture move can not be made.""
Best printed on a home 3D printer. Print the pieces and board home parts 4 times in different colors and the board center in a neutral color. For extra dramatic effect the filament can be changed at 0.75mm so the paths are more dramatic.

We could potentially say there's 480 possibilities if you want to go binary with the wheels.
But that's not the point.
If this set does well I can add future expansions like other cars or a 6-axis option with trains and semi-trucks.

0,963,Walkabot - Gravity Powered Ramp Walking Robot - Parts Plated,"This version is the same as the first Walkabot but the parts have been plated into a single STL file to lower the printing cost if you are going to use the print service.

If you are going to print a Walkabot at home then you will probably find it easier to print with the individual files found here: https://pinshape.com/items/781-3d-printed-walkabot...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Walkabot is a gravity powered ramp walking robot. Place him on a shallow ramp, tilt him to one side, let go and he will walk down the slope. The robot makes a ""walka-walka"" sound as he walks.
See the video of him walking here: http://youtu.be/vgM6PPkw6cQ Assemble the robot by positioning the legs inside the body and pushing the axle through the body and legs as shown in the assembly diagram. The legs should swing freely inside the body. Attach the arms to the outside of the body on the axle. The arms can be moved up and down to adjust the balance slightly. ",1774,Karl_William
0,964,Recovering Supero Hero!,"Looking to be more than just a toy, Esmerald is a wearable game-set that turns the child into a superhero. Designed purposely for children in hospitals, it tells a story: The child is normally a superhero but the arch enemy has stolen all his hero items and its power, sending him or her to the hospital, ill. In order to recover its power and be back in the streets bringing law and order, the child must overcome challenges set by his/her family and doctors, that may include completing certain physical rehabilitation sessions such as chemo, finishing the medicine jar, having the cast removed... or having that dreadful shot taken. After every challenge succeded, the child recovers one of his items. Slowly, his/her powers return fully with every item. 
This makes the stay in the hospital more bearable, fun and challenging, as every new day is an opportunity to recover more power. Of course, this requires the full participation of the family and medical staff, to make the child feel like the superhero he is. 
• Background and research include Child and Teenager Psychology, Pedagogy, and simply having fun while designing it. It was my goal to offer not a plastic figure to the child, but an adventure that turns his stay in bed into something he or she is eager and feels good about accomplishing with the help of everyone. It involves the system around the child to behave differently together for a good cause. Imagine if the whole children's hospital ""played"" this game! It would be a super hero hospital! Every child sharing their progress and asking what the other's powers are!
• Every child can ""design"" their own power items and invent their superhero story, and the toy can be customized. Esmerald is just an example. The items must allow the child to wear them while still in the hospital, attending challenges wearing them, they are his/her powers! (of course maybe shower time is ok not to wear).
• Esmerald power items are printed flat in PLA for faster printing times and then bent while still hot using a pencil or soda can as mold.
Either boys or girls, using Esmerald or creating their own, at a hospital or at home, it doesn't matter.... crime never rests! I hope this idea reaches real children and helps them recover faster and happier!",1502,anny Sanchez

0,1973,Universal 3D Printer Filament Filter,"This small accessory can protect your FFF 3D printer filament from two common issues - cleaning and lubrication.
A sponge wipes the filament clean from any dust particles and prevents them clogging the extruder. By dropping a few drops of common mineral oil on the sponge the filament passing through gets lubricated thus relieving the extruder motor from strain. Lubrication is specially useful if the filament needs to travel through long tubes before it enters the extruder. INSTRUCTIONS 3D-print the provided STL file and insert a small piece sponge into the filament filter. Poke a hole into the sponge and make sure the filament passes through and comes out at the other end. Soak the sponge with a few drops of mineral oil (as for sewing machines, door hinges or bicycle chains). Place the filament filter somewhere in between the spool and the extruder. If you have a plastic tube which guides the filament to extruder (such as a bowden solution) make sure you place the filter before the filament enters the tube.

-------------------------------------
The piece is a tribute to one of my favorite pieces of technology in human history, the Space Shuttle. I was disappointed with the retirement of NASA’s shuttle program, but hopefully greater things will take its place.
It's imperative that human beings constantly remind themselves of our place in space. We need more drive to push the boundaries of our space exploration to ensure our survival.
I created the design after reading Chris Hadfield's book An Astronauts Guide to Life on Earth. I loved reading about his first launch. Walking out to the launch pad for flight in 1995 on the shuttle Atlantis. The surreal idea that he would join one of just a handful of humans to leave the planet.",4110,chuylerwhit

It's designed for a nozzle width of 0.45
Of course if you get a print from the machines here it will come out beautifully first time and you could even do one in each color to have a set of decorative flexing coasters for your tea and scones when the Queen visits.

0,2472,Iconified Shogi,"Shogi is one of the oldest variants of the game that we know as chess. It boasts some very cool mechanics like adding captured opponents to your army and piece promotion by flipping the pieces. However, traditional Shogi sets can scare away potential new players since you need to learn the Japanese characters for the pieces along with their moves.
This set solves both problems at once. Each piece has the name and an icon representing their moves. A blunt line from the sphere means that piece can move or capture one square in that direction. A pointed line from the sphere means that piece can move in as many unobstructed spaces as are available in that direction. The knight moves similar to it's counterpart in western Chess, except that it can only jump to the two spaces in front of it, and to one to the left and right, not the spaces sideways or backwards. Then when you get to the 7th rank flip the piece over to promote it and it's new movement is shown.
This set comes with a modular snap-together board for play on.
Setup and rules can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi",669,joealarso

0,2668,Telescopic Light Saber,"On Friday, November 20th, we were part of the 30 million people to keep their breath while watching the trailer for the next Star Wars movie. As designers, we were surprised to discover a new configuration of the lightsaber revealed in the now epic (and polemic) scene showing an unknown Sith Lord walking in a snowy forest.
As Makers, we couldn’t help but try to find out by ourselves if this “crossguard” design was a good configuration or not... So we decided to build one, with our army of 3D printers.
Of course, the ""darkness"" of the movie sequence and the lack of details on the weapon itself left a lot of place for imagination and interpretation.
A dozen of 3D printable lightsabers being already available for download on internet, we decided to make one that would be completely customizable. The modular system we invented makes hundreds of configurations possible. From Yoda’s lightsaber to Darth Maul’s.
Here's complete video of the crossguard saber's assembly, and in action :https://vimeo.com/113298946",1194,le FabShop

Smoke is flattened on the bottom, serving as a stand for the piece to stay up.
-------------------------------------
The piece is a tribute to one of my favorite pieces of technology in human history, the Space Shuttle. I was disappointed with the retirement of NASA’s shuttle program, but hopefully greater things will take its place.
It's imperative that human beings constantly remind themselves of our place in space. We need more drive to push the boundaries of our space exploration to ensure our survival.
I created the design after reading Chris Hadfield's book An Astronauts Guide to Life on Earth. I loved reading about his first launch. Walking out to the launch pad for flight in 1995 on the shuttle Atlantis. The surreal idea that he would join one of just a handful of humans to leave the planet.",4110,chuylerwhit
0,2713,Celestia Ball jointed pony base Custom blank SMALL size,"25% SMALLER! Celestia Alicorn Base
This small pony is fully articulate with ball joints to create a variety of poses and movement to your doll. Ponies have 15 points of articulation, including the hooves! Comes in pieces, item must be strong with elastic cord. we recommend clear beading cord of .7mm. There is a video to describe how to do so, It is recommended that you have minor crafting experience to be able to string the doll together successfully. Easy to paint and customize into your own character. Acrylics work great to paint your pony with and you can dye the pony with dyes similar to RIT dye or choose from a few dyed color options available here at pinshape/sculpteo. If you want to root hair you can use a dremel to drill in holes to root the hair in small plugs using a needle and thread technique. Item is meant for older collectors and not suitable for very young children. Small parts represent choking hazard. We recommend ages 8 and up and items for display and gentle play.

0,2719,Vega - The LED-lit Christmas Star,"With Creative Tools 3D-printable Vega Xmas Star we want to honor the winners of The Nobel Prize in Physics 2014.
Without the hard and tenacious work of Isamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano and Shuji Nakamura, today we wouldn't have efficient LED lights or HD flatscreen television sets, computers and mobile devices. The 3D-files for Creative Tools 3D-printable Vega Xmas Star are therefore designed to enclose a standard and commonly available LED light strip.

FEATURES 
Modular five-pointed star made of 5 identical parts 
Short segments of 1.75 mm filament hold the parts together (no glue required!) 
Ventilation holes provide cooling airflow 
Wall-mount included for horizontal or vertical attachment Wall-mount allows cable rotation adjustment to easily align star parallel to wall or window. 
Adapted for LED strips 8 x 3 x 1000 mm (12 V, 0.5 A). 
DISCLAIMER 
We have successfully used this star with standard low-power LED strips for indoor use. Please refer to the your LED light source manual and follow all safety instructions. 
PRINT SETTINGS
We recommend 3D-print operators to use transparent PLA plastic filament. Two (2) shells/perimeters are sufficient for strength. For faster prints “rough” resolution at 0.3 or 0.4 can be used and there is no need for infill. You can print at zero (0) percent infill. Turn off support structures. The top section of the star segments are closed automatically via “bridging”. These settings are for filament-based FFF-3D-printers only. 
MATERIAL CONSUMPTION Roughly 70 grams of filament in total. Since the design does not need support structures, no material is wasted. 
MAKE IT IN COLOUR! You can 3D-print in different plastic filament colours. The modular tips of the star also allow for variations in colour per tip. Colour variations can also be achieved by using LED light strips with an RGB colour control.

0,2722,iPhone 6 / iPhone 6+ Macro Close-Up Lens Holder,"Macro lens adapter for the iPhone 6 and 6+ 
This design fits the iPhone 6 and 6+ as well as the iPad Mini. I designed the original version of this for my iPhone 4 when I couldn't find the close-up image quality I wanted. I found a source for a high quality $5 surplus lens that fits into this for excellent macro images. Check out the example photos. 
PLEASE NOTE: This model will not slide over iPhone 6 and 6+ cases. It fits only on an uncovered iPhone. I am working on one for cases. Print this model and then buy a glass lens for $4.50 from Surplus Shed: http://www.surplusshed.com/. Their part number is L4581. For some reason the search function on the Surplus Shed site won't search part numbers. To find L4581, use the ""Lens Finder"" on their home page. In ""Lens Finder"" type:
Lens Type: PCX, Plano Convex
Diameter: 12mm to 12mm
Focal length: 39mm to 39mm
That will get you to L4581.
The lens fits in a recess in the model and is held in place with a drop of Superglue. If you get any glue on the lens, it can be cleaned off with nail polish remover or acetone.
EASY ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS !
The lens is plano-convex (one side is flat). When inserted in the model, the flat side of the lens should face the phone. Press the lens into the opening before applying any glue. Make sure it is seated all the way against the support ring at the bottom of the hole. Again, do this first WITHOUT glue. Once you are sure the lens is properly seated, from the front, squeeze a TINY drop of superglue, at two or three spots around the edge of the lens, into the seam between the lens and the plastic holder.  Each drop will wick around the edge the lens by itself so you won't need to spread it around. Let the assembly sit for 5 minutes before doing any lens cleaning.",8262,lens42

0,2779,3D Printed Bow Tie and Button Cover,"3D Printed Bow Tie and Button Cover. (Support Free)
Software used: 3D Studio Max, Netfabb, Rhinoceros 5. - 
 - 3D Printed Bow Tie: letter ""V"" stands for Victory that shows creativity, confidence and success. This unique Bow tie  replaces the traditional ones from various functional shapes to different materials. The making process is a combine of the use of 3D printers such as PLA, ABS with desktop printer like Makerbot, Ultimaker. Clients can even print them out by using industrial printer (SLS) to complete a perfect finished product.
I have used 3D printer Makerbot Replicator 2 to print out this product. It was printed out separate in 3 different parts, then joint them together. Setting up: Makerbot Replicator 2 Materials: PLA (Spraying with Gold Colour) Infill: 30%
Layer height: 0.15mm; Temperature and Speed: Default.  The products are printed with Raft and ""no support"". Printing time frame is approximately 1 hour. If using desktop printer (FDM) such as Makerbot or Ultimaker, highly recommend that should print each part of products separately to have a nice finishing touch. If products are made all in one file, it is still printable but the travel move might not bring a nice result. 
 - 3D Printed Button Cover: the idea of this product comes from 'something for everyday wear that is functional, fashionable and practical'. This is a 'must-have' items because most shirt nowadays are button shirt, even in the cuff link part. The 3D printed button cover is at first made for 'replacing cuff link' purposes. But because of the art design and flexible function, designer start using it as button covers, give the shirt an ultimate refreshing fashionable look. It is easy to wear by sliding it into your button wherever people want on their shirts- an extraordinary creative and luxurious feel. 
I show on here two Button Cover design which are ""EPIC"" and ""AWESOME"", and wear it on the arm buttons of my shirts. They look stunning and amazing. Same with 3D Printed Bow Tie, this product can also print out in numerous different materials and 3D printers. You can choose to print out in desktop printer (FDM) or industrial printer as SLS.
In this product, I have used Makerbot Replicator 2 to print out.
Setting up: Makerbot Replicator 2
The Face is lay down on the bed
Materials: PLA (Spraying with Gold Colour)
Infill: 80%
Speed while Travelling: 30mm/s
Speed while Extruding: 30mm/s
Printing in 12 minutes. It also works with many different size of buttons. You just need to scale the model before printing out to fit with the buttons of your shirts, jackets. This file was design to fit with the normal shirt of men's wear.",8376,HotVitLo

0,2826,Open Toys,"The Open Toy project is the result of a 2013 workshop at Domaine de Boisbuchet. Samuel N. Bernier had decided to use material waste from the band saw, such as cork and wood, to create toys by 3D printing small accessories with a MakerBot he had brought on site. He designed six accessories that would transform the found objects into planes, helicopters, birds and so on.
It’s was a week after the project had been presented, while looking at the Domaine’s garden, that Bernier had the idea to replace the wood and cork from his project by comestible material such as vegetables and fruits. The vegetables also had the advantage of being easier to pierce without tools than wood.
The project was left behind during almost ten months when Thomas Thibault, intern in Bernier’s design team at le FabShop's creation studio, started creating new parts for the collection. The rocket and submarine parts are from him.
The Open Toys were presented for the first time in October 2014 during a workshop at the Autodesk Pop-Up gallery, in Paris. The kids present at the event transformed with great interest potatoes, carrots, eggplants and cucumbers into cars, sea vehicles and space ships. The Mister Potato from de digital fabrication age had just been invented.
It’s to celebrate the release of their exercise book « Impression 3D Pas à Pas » that le FabShop decided to publish for free download the Open Toys files on all principal 3D printing platform : Thingiverse, YouMagine, Cults 3D and Instructables. Hoping that the users of these communities will contribute to the Open Toys collection big creating new models. Le FabShop’s designers are engaging themselves to do the same in the next months.

The Belt Buckle’s form is purposely simple not to distract away from the content that is being displayed on the screen, it acts as a cradle for any Samsung Galaxy S series smart phone. With an image of your favorite belt buckle chosen and displayed on the screen, the phone is then slipped into the side of the buckle and held by friction.

It is simply, a HIGH TECH BELT BUCKLE.

0,3137,Impossible 3D-printed bolt and nut,"The ""Impossible bolt and nut"" is an amusing 3D-printable two-part assembly with a working thread, where a nut is trapped on a bolt.
The single STL file contains the nut placed at a slight distance from the bolt's head. The gap between both is sized to create a ""skipped"" layer thus making a fracture plane so that the nut can be removed from bolt's head. We have supplied several STL files scaled to commonly available 3D-print heights. Please choose the one that closest fits your desired print height. It is possible to scale the STL up or down with successful results. Please see instructions for more information on how to 3D-print this bolt and nut. Also note that some slicing software and settings could interpret the air gap as an STL defect and remove the gap during print. You will have to disable the STL heal function. Download the STL files and 3D-print your own! :) VIDEO http://youtu.be/GbDMlNjrUM4 The gap There is a gap between the nut and the bolt's head. The size is adjusted so that the slicing software will ""skip"" a layer. This air gap should be small enough for the nut's first layer to adhere to the bolt's head, but still large enough for them to separate easily. We adjusted this gap so that it fits 3D-prints of PLA and ABS. REMOVING THE NUT FROM THE BOLT Make sure you don't cut yourself! Use a thin knife blad and insert it between the bolt's head and the nut. Wiggle it and move it around the bolt until you can feel than the majority of the gap is broken free. Remove the knife and carefully unscrew the nut. CHOOSE THE CORRECT STL FILE We provided several STL files in this thing to fit different 3D printer Z-heights.

0,3144,Deathly Hallows Pendant,"An artistic rendering of the deathly hallows symbol with the actual deathly hallows.
In this 1.5"" tall pendant I combine the items of the Deathly Hallows; the Elder Wand, Resulrection Stone and Invisibility Cloak, into the form of the symbol that describes them. This object is 3D printed to order in your choice of colors.
This unique design by award winning 3D designer Joe Larson is one of a kind takes the imagery of the Deathly Hallows one step further than ever before.
""'The Elder Wand,' he said, and he drew a straight vertical line on the parchment. 'The Resurrection Stone,' he said, and he added a circle on top of the line. 'The Cloak of Invisibility,' he finished, enclosing both line and circle in a triangle, to make the symbol that so intrigued Hermione. 'Together,' he said, 'the Deathly Hallows.'"" -Xenophilius Lovegood

0,3145,Gabriel Schama inspired art piece,"I was inspired by a kickstarter for woodcut art (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1154796888/wood-lasers-art ) by artist Gabriel Schama where he made coordinated patterns in 1/8 wood that were then layered to great effect. The process looked a little to me like the layers of a 3D print, so I decided to see if 3D printing could recreated the effect. I started with modeling the shape, only instead of intentional layers I made gradual slopes that the slicer would create layers. Then I cut it thick (low resolution settings) to see how the effect came out.
In my prints it seems even at high resolution the layers aren't noticable to be used for artistic purposes, which is ironic because they layers have always been too high to be considered smooth. It still makes a nice hanging and is something pretty to look at.

The rhino is a creature of substance, stamina and explosive power. His intimate connection with the earth that makes it a symbol for confidence and steadiness.

0,3160,35mm Film to 120 Spool Adapter,"Do you have a 120 film camera? Want to shoot images with the sprocket holes exposed? Want to shoot specialty films that are not available in 120 format? If so, or you just like to play with film, these adapters are for you. These were designed for the Flyer 6x6 camera developed as a result of the Pinhole Printed Kickstarter project (pinholeprinted.com) but can be used in any 120 medium format camera.
Proven design in use by photographers, this adapter centers 35mm film onto a 120 format spool. There are two parts for the top and bottom of the 35mm film canister. This adapter is perfectly matched to the 120 spool for 35mm, which is at pinshape.com/items/3162-3d-printed-120-takeup-spool-for-35mm-film.
I prefer the Shapeways version for accuracy and durability, but if you download and print your own on a filament printer, you will need to use 50%+ infill, and you may need to do some trimming.
Do not force adapters on. Make sure the splines are aligned and if tight, trim/sand or wiggle on carefully. The splines may need to be trimmed to fit Kalt bulk loading canisters and some others.
The hole for viewing the film number (usually a red window) on the camera must be taped over with black gaffer's tape or some suitable opaque tape to avoid back side exposure of the film. You will need to wind blindly about 1-1/2 turns at the beginning and taper down to 1-1/4 turn at the end. Most medium format cameras have no rewind, so you will need to unload the film in a darkroom or changing bag and manually rewind the 35mm film back into its canister. When processing, specify ""process only"" and ""do not cut"" and cut the film yourself.
If you do not have a 3D printer or have it tied up with other things, check at http://www.pinholeprinted.com/order/35mm-film-to-120-spool-adapter/ for alternatives.

0,3165,Stacking box,"Think inside the box, you can never have to many boxes.
Print a few of your own stacking boxes to keep your things in order may they be screws, nuts, bolts, toys or other miscellaneous things.
Just like our Candy Bowl we designed this box specifically for testing 3D-prints with large-bore nozzles. The result is a semi-transparent box 3D-printed at 0.8mm layerheight with a 1.0 mm nozzle.
Even though it is possible to print this box at higher speeds, we kept it down to achieve a high-gloss shiny surface toghether with a all together higher quality print. This shows very well in the two attached pictures with the lower part being printed at a higher speed than the top part. Not only will the result have a higher degree of transparency but the print quality will also be alot better since the plastic can be extruded and cooled down at a lower rate which is needed when extruded with a larger size nozzle.
The outer dimensions of the box is 120x120x80mm. At around 20-30 mm/s it took less than two hours to print.
We have kept the geomtry as simple as possible to make it easy to print. To get rid of the layer-change zipper-line we used vase-mode in our print settings.
To make the box strong and achieve optimal transparency we 3D-printed the candy bowl using taulman 3D t-glase (PETT) filament.

The first file is the entire model; the following five files are the model broken up into sections of its parts.  I printed this model all in one file on standard resolution, using a support structure and on a raft. That being said, the hull really does needs support and the gun & axles will benefit from a raft and/or grid. I found it really difficult to remove the support structure around the wheels and it was not needed. I also have included the model split into sections as to reduce print area and to allow for custom settings on the individual files. The parts fit tightly, so filing and sanding will probably be necessary to allow all appropriate parts to move freely.

Rotating Turret

0,3202,Julia Earrings,"Fractal earrings with integrated hooks. These attractive earrings are the visualisation of a mathematical concept : iterated polynomia in the quaternion space, also known as Julia sets. I've integrated the hooks that fit naturally with the general structure of the object.",55,993
0,3203,Dragon Pendant,"Dragon fractal pendant. The shape of this fractal - based on a quaternionic Julia set- ressembles a dragon. It represents the result of mathematical calculations, and so might exist even without the intervention of human beings. Pure beauty and elegance of nature, made reality into an elegant pendant, here 3D printed in brass, hand-polished and gold plated.",55,993

0,3209,Beadlock Wheel (Size 1.9),"This is a 1.9 beadlock wheel for your R/C Crawler. This will fit the Axial SCX-10, Losi MRC and Vaterra Ascender Style trucks. These are printed in four pieces to eliminate the need for support material. To assemble the wheels, you will need - 12 - 3x10mm button screws and 6 - 3x8mm button screws. ",10489,Adam @ Spare Time Ho

0,3213,East Van Cross,My 3D interpretation of Ken Lum's iconic East Van Cross,3379,John Biehler
0,3214,Tablet Car Mount,I wanted a mount for my Nexus 7 tablet in my Kia Soul that could easily be stowed if I wasn't using the tablet and for security. I used part of a cheap tablet case for easy removal of the tablet and hot glued this 3D printed part that goes into the CD slot to the back of the case shell. This should be compatible with any 'mini' sized tablet case...not sure how a bigger device would fair from a weight standpoint. You could likely also print any case that is a similar clip-in style and glue this part to it as well. Note: I'm not responsible if this damages your cd player....it works in my car fine but yours may be different.,3379,John Biehler
0,3215,Digital Coupland,"I recently met with Douglas Coupland and 3D scanned him with my Structure scanner and Skanect. This model is my low poly version of Doug. The painted model was done with Rustoleum ""Hammered"" paint.",3379,John Biehler
0,3216,Another Scanned Cactus,This is a 3D scan of a touch lamp cactus. It turned out pretty well considering all the spines on the cactus. Scanned with a Structure 3D Scanner from Occipital.,3379,John Biehler
0,3217,Scanned Cactus,"Updated scan of my ceramic cactus from a Mexican market. Scanned with an Occipital Structure 3D Scanner, iPad Mini and Skanect. More details here: http://johnbiehler.com/2014/06/19/hands-structure-3d-scanner/",3379,John Biehler
0,3218,Imperial 40mm Fan Guard,Seemed appropriate on Star Wars Day to remix the Star Wars Imperial logo with a 40mm fan guard for my Replicator 2. Also includes a raised logo in case you want to pause the print and swap filament at the 3mm point for a splash of color. Note I haven't printed this yet so I'm unsure if the logo interferes with the intake for the fan...will be testing it soon. I have an alternate (smaller logo) version I'll post if this one is problematic. Update It printed fine and seems to be a little quieter than my previous guard. I may reprint it in something other than black though...the LED lighting really hits it...something with extra UV might be cool.,3379,John Biehler
0,3219,Voronoi Cactus,"After seeing the results that DaniSaez got using Meshlab, I had to try making it with my scanned cactus model (hence the remix hat tip). I watched this video and applied the same filters to the cactus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWSeZk2IqHg I think it turned out pretty well...a few droopy strands on one side but otherwise very printable.",3379,John Biehler
0,3220,Camera cover for Google Glass,"Inspired by Luis' remixed version of the original, I trimmed it as well. Perfectly slides onto the Glass and keeps the prism clear.",3379,John Biehler
0,3221,Toilet Sign,"Couldn't find the kind of sign I was looking for so I made one. Starting with an SVG file from the web of the standard restroom icons of a man/woman, I then used DNewman's excellent Inkscape to OpenSCAD plugin to export the image to an STL (toilet-figures.stl). I've included the SCAD output as well. Then using Tinkercad.com, I put the figures on top of a rectangle to approximate the sign I was looking for. I've included both an outline version and a stacked 'extruded' version depending on how you'd like to print them. The outline version is pretty straightforward. The extruded version can be printed in two colors by pausing the print at the 4mm mark and swapping colors (I have a single extruder MakerBot Replicator 2). Tinker the extruded version or the outline version on Tinkercad.com",3379,John Biehler
0,3222,Printable Werewolf Deck,"Inspired by Max Temkin's take on the Werewolf card game, this is a simple printable version of the cards to make your own deck that I made in Tinkercad. I haven't printed these yet but they should print fine. I'll update the post once I've had a chance to print a set.",3379,John Biehler
0,3223,Low Poly Mexican Cactus,I've been kind of obsessing over printing low poly models lately so figured I should convert my own model. Decimated down to 500 faces in Meshlab. This model was featured on Tested.com's Mystery Build Friday which is pretty cool: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4kPt1HI_hg,3379,John Biehler
0,3224,Printrbot Simple Filament Guide,Was having problems with the filament drifting on the direct drive extruder of the Printrbot Simple (v2) so I merged the STL version of the laser cut parts and added an extension tube in Tinkercad. I'm still having issues with the filament not grabbing enough or too much and chewing it up but that's another problem to solve. This thing was made with Tinkercad. Edit it online https://tinkercad.com/things/4OLHjwm587B,3379,John Biehler

Edit it online https://tinkercad.com/things/fwT7KI4RqKE UPDATE: I've added a v2 of the backplate with a larger Empire logo that is now external rather than embossed in the plate. You can find it on Tinkercad here: https://tinkercad.com/things/04XMdXfTwrT,3379,John Biehler
0,3227,YxYY trinket,I made these to give away at the inaugural YxYY conference in Palm Springs. They were a huge hit at an amazing conference. Can't wait for next year! This thing was made with Tinkercad. Edit it online https://tinkercad.com/things/13129ms51DR,3379,John Biehler
0,3228,Printrbot Simple Z-Endstop Activator holder,I broke the lasercut parts for the Z axis endstop activator holder (see photo of wooden parts that hold the screw which triggers the endstop) while assembling my Printrbot Simple kit so I took the STL parts and merged them in Tinkercad to make a preassembled replacement. A perfect replacement although I did have to tap the holes to get them started but you could easily use a drill bit. This thing was made with Tinkercad. Edit it online https://tinkercad.com/things/gUXLF4Brtcb,3379,John Biehler

0,3232,3D Lanyard,"Wanted a unique lanyard for the upcoming Calgary Mini Maker Faire so I made one. Inspired by Adafruit's 3d Printer sticker/patch that resembles my MakerBot Thing-O-Matic. This thing was made with Tinkercad. Edit it online https://tinkercad.com/things/48Lax3yJJOS Added a 2nd version with ""printer"" text and printed it in ""glow in the dark"" blue - the photo doesn't do it justice!",3379,John Biehler
0,3233,Arcade Cabinet,Found a perfect arcade cabinet on the Sketchup Warehouse: http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=127eacdcb8e67bb573b4ec5aa28d567a&prevstart=96 Cleaned up the model with Netfabb to make it a little more printable.,3379,John Biehler

0,3235,Cactus,"Using Jetty's awesome OmNomNom app, I was finally able to print a cactus from an iPhone photo of a plastic cactus I got from a party supply store years ago. I used the medallion option and edited the OpenSCAD to make the base=0. Also, I'm surprised this is the first (tagged) cactus on Thingaverse!",3379,John Biehler
0,3236,Vancouver Canucks logo,"Created via Jetty's awesome OmNomNom app (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:24639) from a jpg of the Canucks logo. I commented out the base from the OpenSCAD to make it just the logo. UPDATE: Uploaded a cleaned up, decimated and repaired file that should print much better.",3379,John Biehler
0,3237,XBee Explorer Dongle Case,Wanted a case for the Xbee Explorer Dongle from Sparkfun: http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9819 So I made one. This thing was made with Tinkercad. Edit it online https://tinkercad.com/things/epx6ZUHNISU,3379,John Biehler
0,3238,ToM Gen 4 Interface Kit cover,Wanted a cover to protect the top of the Gen 4 Interface Kit since it has the exposed ribbon cable wiring. This is the first version I attempted...gravity holds it in place and it's not level due to the acrylic plate angle. V2: wider top (covers the wood) and more of a cap than a cover Print whichever one you prefer. This part was made with Tinkercad. Edit the part online at: https://tinkercad.com/things/9r2sBLXVxv8 V2: https://tinkercad.com/things/5U7Wjh98Hsm,3379,John Biehler
0,3239,Prusa X-End Idler with snap fit LM8UU channel,"I printed the original version by DXBLouie but found I couldn't get my LM8UUs into the channel on the idler. I downloaded the SCAD files and think the problem was that the original configuration.SCAD file was set to the wrong bushing type. In any case, I changed the bushing type in configuration.SCAD and regenerated the STL for the idler and it appears to work now as I was able to snap in the LM8UUs. It's worth noting though that the LM8UUs I have (from Mixshop.ca) are shorter than the normal ones which may or may not make a difference. Anyways, I've included the updated SCAD files just in case anyone else runs into a similar issue.",3379,John Biehler
0,3240,Thing-O-Matic Camera Platform,"Using the excellent Tinkercad file by Physics Dude that this thing is derived from, it seemed like the perfect platform to attach a webcam to. I simply erased the unnecessary tool holder parts and put a tripod mount hole in the middle. I also made a larger platform that can move the camera further away from the print area if your webcam requires that or so you have a bigger surface to clamp just about anything onto. I have a Microsoft LifeCam that has a tripod mount point and used the mounting screw from a gorillapod that I normally use to shoot timelapses or simply remotely monitor the printer with. Feel free to adjust as necessary by making a copy in Tinkercad: Small: https://tinkercad.com/p/acc06bf989380100/53 Big: https://tinkercad.com/p/acc0eb3a3fe504be/19",3379,John Biehler

How to play:
Place the robot token on the last bend of the track.
Place the boy token on the start line.
Every time the boy finishes a question without help he moves forward.
Every time a teacher or parent tells the boy to get back on task the robot moves forward.
If the robot wins the game resets, if the boy wins he gets a treat.

My understanding is that late governor Robert ""Fighting Bob"" La Follete, sensing the future greatness of Packers football in the Badger State, slipped this requirement into the state constitution in 1902 after meeting the as-yet-unborn Vince Lombardi's mother in a Brooklyn pizzeria.

Shark Week? Sharknado? Pfah. Finger Shark. If you've ever done a 3D printing demo you've seen a dozen kids get all excited about the technology, watched your printer struggle to burp out a Yoda before the event ends, and then seen dejected kids walk away empty-handed. (A brief note to folks who do 3D printing demos: as of August 2014 there are more 3D printed Yodas in the world than there are children, so you can stop printing them now.) Never again, my friends. Finger Shark is fun, fashionable, and fabricates fast. Print a dozen to chum the waters at your next Maker event. Finger Shark is designed for a size 7 ring, which should snugly fit the fingers of most adults. You'll need to scale all three parts of Finger Shark to fit smaller fingers. To that end, the handy-dandy Zheng3 Ring Sizing PDF will help you teach a little basic algebra while the kids are printing finger sharks.

Irrigation is the order of the season, and polyurethane serpents dutifully follow our favorite chatelaine while she quenches the thirsts of young basils, zukes, and tomatoes. But she is busy, busy! and without a garden guardian's vigilance an overlooked dragon's tail might scythelike reap a row of tulips. It has happened before. Never again, my friends. Never. Again. Read about the remix and modeling process over at Zheng3.com, and see the post-production process on Instagram.

These hangers are designed to fit a 5/8"" (16mm) PVC pipe and have a hole and countersink for a drywall screw. Everything's Better With Drywall Screws. Includes a capped end and an open internal hanger. Scaling to fit other diameters of PVC is left as an exercise for the reader. Installation under heavy load or in areas prone to pronounced seismic activity is not recommended.",10770,zheng3
0,4083,Edsal Storage Unit Footing,"The lovely and talented Mrs. Zheng3's passion is gardening, and, vinelike, her hobby-but-so-much-more extends tendrils throughout our homestead every spring. Ere long the house and yard will be overrun and four months hence we will smother under bushels of heirloom tomatoes. Yesterday the garage was infiltrated by a new storage unit, soon to be stocked with chrysanthemum powder, mushroom compost, and myriad other eye-of-newtish polypropylene sacks with contents beyond my ken. Alas! The shelving arrived unshod, and past experience tells me that corner of the garage will most certainly flood with the first significant rain of the season, so to the printer we go to keep the unit's legs rust-free. This footing is designed for an Edsal Storage Rack, but will likely fit others with some finagling of scale. These racks are rated for two tons, so I recommend printing these footings at high infill.",10770,zheng3
0,4084,Spray Can Cap,"This. Everything the human race has been working towards in the last 10,000 years culminates in this, the single most useful object in the universe. Every advance in thermoplastics, every hour of every day and night spent by the original RepRap team, every moment of Edison's rejuvenating catnaps, every ellipse Newton drew, Euclid's scratches in the dust at Alexandria, agriculture, the first flake of flint noticed by a clever ape, each of these is a link in the unbroken chain of progress that leads to this model. Along with Archimedes, Turing, Salk, Berners-Lee, Stepanov, Von Liebig, and countless others who helped establish the infrastructure required to make this spray can top we must also credit Kelly Egan for creating the original model. I have modified Egan's opus and thereby assured my place in history by enlarging and directing the spray chamber. Until 3d printers are capable of sub-micron resolution, we must enable the spray by pushing a hot needle through the nozzle. The maximizing of aerosolization is left as an exercise for the reader.",10770,zheng3
0,4086,Tinkeriffic BB Bearing 58mm Spool Spindle,"Crikey. It's another Tinkeriffic bearing spool spindle. My Faire Play Kickstarter was funded to the tune of 120%, and now I'm printing backer rewards. I got myself a new roll of gold filament and of course it doesn't fit any of the bearings I've made so far, because that would make things easy and apparently Hera's mad at me for only making an Athena Makeover Kit. I'm cursed. A wiser man would take the time to create a Tinkeriffic bearing in Thingiverse's customizer, and then adjust bearings parametrically as needed. But Lao Zheng ain't got no time to be learnin' no Customizer, foo! So I banged this out in Maya in like eight seconds. Enjoy. This spool spindle is designed to fit a 58 mm spool, like this one I got from BuMat. This three-part solution (thirteen parts, if one counts the 4.5mm BB's) is designed to use a Tinkertoy rod as an axle and is a much, much smoother ride for your filament spools. I found inserting BB's into the original 608 bearing to be frustrating so I split the bearing in two and left it to the end user to super glue the parts together. The walls of the inner spool are by necessity quite thin; I recommend multiple shells or high infill for that part.",10770,zheng3
0,4087,Faire Play Recurve Bow,"On March 27, 2014, the Faire Play Kickstarter reached its fundraising goals with a fortnight to spare. As a thank you to our backers and media enablers, I've created the Faire Play Recurve Bow and Quiver. This bow is sculpted from organic, locally-sourced vertices, filtered and purified from the droppings of only the mimsiest free-range borogoves, and it'll fire a 6"" cosmetic swab across a room with dismissive ease. It's a two-piece print, so a little glue will be required before use. If Faire Play can reach its modest new stretch goal, I'll be re-sculpting the bow into a single-piece Shapeways print so that anyone can make their dolls deadly at range with a couple of clicks. One more time, huge thanks to everyone who has supported this project so far.",10770,zheng3
0,4088,Athena Makeover Kit,"Update 01/14/2015 A new Kickstarter appears! Announcing Faire Play 2: When in Rome.

Watch the Kickstarter video and share http://kck.st/1FQ7FZf with your social media pals! Sing, O muse, of science and of art and of trials and tessellation and tribulations, of dawn-laboring Zheng, and Barbie of the slim ankles. Acolytes rush to Delphi's shimmering pool to behold the emerging vision. Great Hera! A Kickstarter begins! UPDATE Faire Play was a sucess! The Kickstarter was overfunded and the Parade Armor is finished and on sale to the rest of the world. With Faire Play, I'm making 3D printed medieval armor for Barbie dolls. To the goddess of Wisdom I offer this Athena Makeover Kit as tribute, so that She may guide this campaign to success. Watch Barbie's debut in full battle gear in the Kickstarter video, and support Open Source design while you're there. The spear and aegis should clip on to pretty much any doll that's roughly Barbie-sized, but the boots are designed specifically for a doll in the Barbie Fashionistas line. I've got the prototype medieval armor finished and reliably printing on an FDM printer, now I just need to make it look fabulous.

I've long wanted to design a model that would be difficult to manufacture with traditional means.

0,4094,Tinkeriffic BB Bearing 32mm Spool Spindle,"The original Tinkeriffic Spool Spindle (of 2012 vintage) functioned adequately, but was never a baby's-butt-smooth solution to my filament feeding fiascoes. This three-part solution (thirteen parts, if one counts the 4.5mm BB's) is designed to use a Tinkertoy rod as an axle and is a much, much smoother ride for your 32mm filament spools. I found inserting BB's into the original 608 bearing to be frustrating so I split the bearing in two and left it to the end user to super glue the parts together. The walls of the inner spool are by necessity quite thin; I recommend multiple shells or high infill for that part.",10770,zheng3
0,4095,Seej Avatar Pedestal,"This model introduces a new rule variant to Seej: Avatars. It's designed for easy remixing with other models so that your personal representation can join the field of battle. A player fielding an avatar on a pedestal may increase his stockpile by 10 projectiles. The avatar must wear loosely-attached headgear. Hats, helmets, tiarae, crowns, colanders, et cetera all qualify as legitimate headgear. Remember Core Rule #3 and don't attach your avatar's headgear too tightly. If the avatar's headgear falls off during the game, the player fielding the avatar immediately loses the match. Basic rules for Seej are at http://www.s33j.net.",10770,zheng3

The classic catapult gets improvements inspired by community feedback, too. It's all compatible with older prints, and is much, much more accurate. Seej is an Open Source tabletop wargame designed to advance the state of 3d printing through competition and player-directed evolution.

0,4163,Intuition Pendant,"My inspiration for this pendant design is women in engineering. I think it would look most interesting as a multi-material or multi-color print in metals or plastic.
I want my design to empower young women entering challenging male-dominated fields such as engineering to maintain their femininity, positive attitude and self-confidence during their career journey. It will remind the wearer that they have the strength and skills needed to persevere and succeed.
I called it intuition because I believe women's intuition is an invaluable asset to the field of engineering. The organic shape of my pendant has been produced using structural topology optimization software from Altair called solidThinking Inspire and I rendered the result in solidThinking Evolve. I did not use the software provided for the competition. solidThinking is used by leading additive manufacturing companies and can be used to design everything from automotive and airplane components to buildings to consumer goods packaging.
Someday, I want women in technical fields to feel so comfortable in their work environment that it feels natural to everyone for them to be there. Personally, if I wore this pendant into a meeting, it would give me an interesting talking point with my customers. Recently, I exchanged 3d printed key chains with another female engineer, so it could also be a fun hobby to collect and trade 3d printed jewellery.",10614,jacquel

The lampshade he imagined has an aesthetic inspired by folded paper, the layers created by the M200 being so smooth they actually feel like a completely flat surface. The Susanna lamp can be used as a suspension or a table light. All you need to ad is an e27 socket with cable and an LED lightbulb to complete it.

0,4295,Floating arm trebuchet (dimes and pennies),"This trebuchet uses a floating arm rather than a fixed arm. That means that the weights can fall completely vertical resulting in a more efficient and powerful throw compared to standard trebuchet designs. See a test firing shot here: http://i.imgur.com/9QZHuB0.gif
Assembly should be fairly straight forward. You will need 2 toothpicks and 2 and 10-15cm of string along with the 3d printed parts. You need to print two of the weight, the stand, and the wheel. Everything else just print 1. You will need to orient each shape properly as I did not build them on the plane they were to be printed at.
I printed the parts at 0.025mm height with 0.05mm width. Some parts are small and are exactly 1mm in width so these settings ensure that they match up exactly with no small gaps.
side1 and side2 should pushed together until they are flush. This might be a bit hard, but this is to ensure that they stay in place and will not come apart. I used a small vice to push pins together that I couldn't get with my hands. The stands just snap on to the assembled frame.
The sling should just snap together. Once the 2 halves are together make sure they swing freely. If they do not you may need to make some small edits to the file to get the piece configured correctly for your printer. These are small pieces so some variation may occur. The current size of the hole and pin worked great for me. The hinge stays together and swings loosely so the coin can fly out with no resistance.
For the arm take one of your toothpicks and cut it in half. One half will be your firing pin so save that for later. With the other half but it down to 9mm in length. This goes through the hole that is second from the top of the arm (top being the thickest end of the arm). Next push the two wheels, one to each end of the toothpick. The other toothpick secures the weights and the arm to the frame. It goes through one vertical slit, then through the top most hole of the arm, the through the far slit. Once this is done you can slide the weights onto each side and fill the weights with dimes. You could increase the size of the weight holders if you want to use pennies or some other denomination.
For the string...one piece goes through the bottom most hole of the arm and then through one of the string holes on the sling. Another piece of string must be made into a loop on one end and the attached to the other string hole on the sling. When loaded, the sling should be about in the center of the frame with the strings taut. Too long and it will not have enough power to swing the strings, too short and it will throw your coins into the ground every time. Experiment a bit to find that sweet spot.
If you have any trouble just look up how trebuchets work and you should be able to sort it out.",11240,Andrew Claa
0,4296,A Visit To Paris,"The theme for this design is a Parisian pendant. This powerhouse of fashion and haute couture provides rich inspiration in terms of shapes and styles with its rich history and architecture. The challenge is how to produce something instantly recognizable and yet retain a freshness and uniqueness in the design. The method? take something iconic, destroy it and reconstruct it taking it in a new direction. The skyline of Paris is dominated by the majestic Eiffel tower conjured from rivets and wrought iron, braced with beams and trusses, a slender yet masculine aesthetic. Another Parisian specialty is the flowing wrought iron gates with beautiful floral patterns decorating many public buildings. Combining these elements and crowning them with a warm rose gold hue this pendant is instantly familiar yet altogether different, a fitting homage to the city of lights.

0,4298,Pi Bracelet,"The Pi Bracelet is made up of 9 interlocking links, each with a couple of digits of Pi on it - a total of 14 digits after the decimal (3.14159265358979) and one link with the Pi symbol. Each link is approx 16mm square not including the linkage - and the complete set of links, when connected as  bracelet, measures approx 215mm long - fitting an adult average wrist pretty well. Links can be left off to make the design smaller. The whole design can be scaled down to make it work better on kids' wrists. The image shows an 80% and 100% version.
Link Design:  The links connect using a custom design which makes it mostly easy to connect, but harder to fall apart. To connect the links, you put them at a 90 degree angle to one another, with the male/pin portion under the female/mortise portion - pushing the pin into the mortise and then straightening the pair until they click in. Separate using the opposite motion. There is often some brim material on the bottom of the model which needs to be worn down before the connection can be made easily - but this actually helps to keep the connection firm and secure.
It might take some connecting and un-connecting to make the pairs of links move and flex freely to lay comfortably on your wrist.

0,4489,Bangle Bearing,"I always have a copy of Emmett's brilliant Gear Bearing out on the coffee table - it's such a great talking point and introduction to 3D printing - and recently someone I showed it to suggested it might make an interesting bangle. I'm not sure about its fashion-worthiness, but as a printing challenge I thought it was an excellent idea. I had already used an idea by Sal to print gear bearings with large circular holes instead of small hexagonal ones (http://www.thingiverse.com/make:26306), so I just took this up to the next level. I have posted the modified .scad file so the design is still fully parametric, and also a copy of the STL file that works with the tolerances on my printer. Here is the video of the bangle working as a gear bearing (but not as a fashion item!) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt39vLo5l90",11637,Richard Ga
0,4490,PifPaf with Turn by Gregory Benedetti,The four identical pieces of this interlocking puzzle make up a 5x5x3 cuboid. Gregory Benedetti is the designer of this puzzle and the plans are freely available on Puzzle Will Be Played. The pieces of this puzzle would impossible to print on a RepRap without support enabled. So instead I split the main shaft in two and used LockBlock connectors to join them back together (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:27695).,11637,Richard Ga
0,4491,Four Mirror One puzzle by Osanori Yamamoto,"This is a fantastic puzzle! It's not too easy, nor is it too hard to solve. It comes from the mind of a brilliant Japanese puzzle inventor called Osanori Yamamoto, whose Bisect Cube puzzle was one of the first things I uploaded to Thingiverse. Not only are all his designs very clever puzzles, but many of them are also ideally suited to 3D printing as they require no additional support. The puzzle consists of one ring shaped piece and four identical T pieces. These must be assembled with the Ts arranged in a mirrored pairing as shown in the photo. The design was downloaded from the Puzzle Will be Played website at http://www.puzzlewillbeplayed.com/643Ring/FourMirrorOne/",11637,Richard Ga
0,4492,Tetradyma by Yavuz Demirhan,Yavuz Demirhan is a prolific Turkish puzzle inventor with nearly150 published designs at Puzzle Will Be Played ( http://puzzlewillbeplayed.com/-/designer/Demirhan.xml ). Tetradyma is one of his latest and is unusual in that it requires four identical pieces to fit into a cube shape. It is also printable without needing any support material. I would rate it as tricky but not difficult - a great design to give to novice puzzlers.,11637,Richard Ga
0,4493,Printable Interlocking Puzzle #3 - Level 4 by Bram Cohen,"I am proud to present a new Printable Interlocking Puzzle Cube, but this time I didn't design it. Following the release of PIP#2, I was contacted by Bram Cohen (puzzle designer and author of the BitTorrent protocol) asking whether I had found any printable interlocking puzzle cube designs with a level higher than 1, i.e. needing more than a single move to take the first piece out. This sounded like a great challenge and I set about about trying to design one but then Bram beat me to it - not once but twice. As Bram commented in his email, "" the main thing causing difficulties is that the printed bottom of the pieces can't be facing the outside directly, because then they can just be pulled off as the first move, but because the bottom must by definition have the most voxels, putting those on the interior makes it very hard to fill up all the external voxels and not stuff shut the internal voxels."" His first attempt was a level 2 puzzle cube but that was quickly superseded by this very clever level 4 design. EDIT: (23/12/2014) Thanks to a great piece of work by mateddy (see http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:569118) I can finally make this puzzle available in OpenSCAD format.",11637,Richard Ga
0,4494,Printable Interlocking Puzzle #2,"Designed on Christmas Day 2012, here is the second of my series of printable interlocking puzzles, and this time it's a 4x4x4 cube. 'Printable' means no support material required. 'Interlocking' means the puzzle pieces fit together only in the correct sequence and will not fall apart when the puzzle is moved. This puzzle is much more challenging than PIP#1 so I will be happy to provide a solution on request, if you need it. Update: The solution video is at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNIwRid7390",11637,Richard Ga

0,4499,Ducted 60 mm fan for Mendel90,"I printed a selection of fan ducts for my Mendel90. Some of them didn't fit and others just didn't work, so I designed my own. I have copied some of the best features from other designs and merged them into a model that will fit on the Mendel90 using a couple of adapters for mounting. Update - April 2013 - my original fan duct was getting a little overheated so I finally got around to redesigning a slightly longer version which centres the nozzle better. Update 2 - the all-metal E3D hot end needs a cooling fan and shroud fitted to it. There was not enough space to fit this so I have released an updated low-profile version at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:91931",11637,Richard Ga
0,4500,Crouching Woman by Auguste Rodin,"This dramatic statue is in the Hirshhorn Sculpture Garden in the Washington DC mall. http://dcmemorials.com/index_indiv0000455.htm I selected it partly for the interesting subject matter and partly because it looked pretty printable, with no serious overhangs. I took 30 high resolution photos from all around the statue and uploaded them using 123D Catch to make the model.",11637,Richard Ga
0,4501,Lockblock - printable connector,"Many puzzle pieces have complex shapes with inevitable overhangs whichever way you orient them. I would like to try soluble support material but I don't yet have dual extruder printing capability. Ordinary support material leaves nasty marks on the downward-facing surfaces. My latest idea was to split the piece horizontally through the middle and print the two halves facing upwards with a custom connecting joint on top of each piece. The joint consists of a triangular peg next to a triangular hole, all contained within the outline of a single cube. The prototype was first modelled in Tinkercad and then transferred to OpenSCAD for easier customisation. Watch the video of the first test at http://youtu.be/Fp63gR9HTJA",11637,Richard Ga

0,4510,Bobbins for intarsia,"When I had the privilege of meeting nophead and his good lady last month, one of the questions I was asked was whether I had made lots of useful things for my wife. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I had only made her a keyring, so far. My opportunity came yesterday when she asked me for help with a specific problem. My wife enjoys making things as well but her filaments are more of the sewing and knitting variety. Recently, she has been experimenting with a kind of knitting called intarsia, which calls for lots of different coloured strands of wool to be in use at the same time to build a picture. You'll get the idea from this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G4yzCzpHk (skip to 3:30 to see the bobbins). I designed the basic shape in Tinkercad and then did a bit of tweaking in Blender. She was delighted with the result and now understands how useful my expensive new toy can really be.",11637,Richard Ga
0,4511,Cube Libre puzzle,This a great little puzzle by Mineyuki Uyematsu that I saw on Puzzle Will Be Played last week. http://puzzlewillbeplayed.com/444/CubeLibre/ It's another great example of a printable puzzle that requires no support on RepRap printers. These 10 puzzle pieces can make both an 8x8 square and a 4x4x4 cube.

0,4512,Bisect Cube puzzle by Osanori Yamamoto,"I love designing, making, solving and collecting interlocking 3D puzzles.

I discovered this brand new puzzle here http://puzzlewillbeplayed.com/553Ring/BisectCube/ at the excellent 'Puzzle Will Be Played' website and immediately realised that it was printable on my new eMaker Huxley machine.

2 CDs glue or double-sided tape A threaded bolt 1/2"" long or slightly longer with a thread diameter of 1/4"" or less
A corresponding nut
2 washers (optional but recommended)
Print in ABS or PLA at 15% infill. The base and top need to be printed with a diameter of 6 inches. The base is 1/4"" high and the top is 1/2"" high. If you want a lazy susan without a lip on the edge, just print another base, instead of the top.
The large indentation is for the CDs. Glue or tape the label side of the CD to the indentation. The shiny side of the CDs are facing each other when the top and base are put together. Run the bolt through the center hole and tighten. The CDs are very low friction and will allow the spice rack to rotate without the use of ball bearings.

Building off of my previous modular spaceship building sets, I've incorporated magnets to allow for fast and and easy reconfiguration. This set contains the basic components needed for a small ship, and these basic components will be interchangeable with new parts that are coming soon. Note: you will need 5 mm magnetic balls to complete this assembly. I use the (now illegal) BuckyBall magnets that everyone seems to have on their desks. Because the parts are scaled for 5 mm magnets, you could potentially re-size the model to fit different magnets (4 mm magnets - scale to 80%, 6 mm magnets - scale up 120% and so on). IMPORTANT: BuckyBalls (and similar magnetic toys) were taken off the market for a very good reason!

I printed everything with 2 shells and 10% infill. Make sure you use at least two shells on the drip tray so it doesn't leak.

UPDATE 3/19/15: I made a silver version with an extrude subtract by .6mm. The total thickness is 1mm. You can see that the Redbird logo is subtracted all the way through. I also increased the text size quite a bit. UPDATE 3/25/15: I was able to get red text on top with a nice transition. I added a square off the the side so I could change the filament while it was filling the box. The last picture shows the current version.

backstory:
After working in the retail fashion world selling designer brands for a number of years, I decided to become a designer myself. Last year I started up a handcrafted jewelry business. Since my husband is an engineer, and introduced me to 3D printing I slowly began adding 3D printed items to my jewelry line. Surfing the web for inspiration for developing more 3D printed jewelry I came across the Pinshape/ Elle Time & Jewelry Design Competition.
what inspired it:
I was inspired to create a sophisticated necklace pendant for this competition by the modern, sleek necklace pendants on the Elle Time & Jewelry website.",10821,hari.henning.12

Story Behind: 
 The design is base form the character of Maria Clara in the novel entitled 'Noli Me Tangere', which was written by a Filipino national heroe Dr. Jose Rizal. The story was all about Spain and Philippines as their colony base on an actual Philippine history during 1800's. Within the story, she is a girlfriend of Krisostomo Ibbara (Dr. Jose Rizal's depicted character in the novel), the epitome of virtue, ""demure and self-effacing"" and endowed with beauty, grace and charm, and ideal image of a woman who deserves to be placed on the ""pedestal of male honour"". Maria Clara (Leonora Rivera in real life) was actually a real life girlfriend of Dr. Jose Rizal. Until the present time, the name Maria Clara was then emulates character's traits of being delicate, feminine, self-assured and with a sense of identity. 
Design Structure:
 It's hard to make a stunning design specially when the designed is just a monochromatic color and is not required to put some precious stone. So I isolated a small sphere on the center to create an illusion of something like a precious stone at the center. Plus an engraved letter M on it stands for Maria and C shape of the whole ring structure stands for Clara. And i also put some wavy minimal designs to emphasize its feminism even more.",11693,Lomell Rueca

Marketability: Not only woman will love the design. This will be in demand specially also by guys who want a special gifts for their loved ones, crushes, and for the girls they are courting with. This will be a very clear message that she's the one for the guy. An apple of the eye.
Story Behind:
The concept in simply. As have been said to the title, it's an apple of the eye. It refers to something or someone that one cherishes above all others.
In Old English, the pupil of the eye (the round, dark center) was called the 'apple'. It was thought that the pupil was a round object much like an apple (a piece of fruit). When you look at someone, their reflection appears in your pupil. So if someone is the 'apple of your eye', he or she is someone that you look at a lot and enjoy seeing. 
Also, base on some surveys that have been already conducted by some experts, boys are much easier to fall in love with women so it was really indeed that women are the most qualified to hold the title of being an apple of the eye in planet among genders.
Design Structure:
The gold red (apple) represents the pupil of the eye while the silver are the aye lashes. An illusion of eye will appear when you turn it 90 degree counter clock wise. I decided to turn the apple into gold (red) color to say even more profound that women are the most precious and loved ones by us boys :)

0,4757,Ocean Pearl Necklace,"Intro
As a concept designer and toy modeler working in the games industry I always start my creative thinking process by putting down words and ideas on paper before picking up the pencil.
Idea behind the design
For this jewelry contest my initial idea was to base the design on the the theme of water, choosing words like “pearl”, “ocean waves”, “movement” and “water drops”. (Not sure if this is just me wanting to be summer already :D)
Water is a symbol of purity and is the source of life. Pearls are simple in shape and whitish/silverish and are considered the gemstone of kings, pharaohs, emperors and gods. Waves are symbol of free spirit and motion/movement. You will see all these incorporated in my final design. 
I think every woman will want to portray these things, so why not saying it with this jewelry?
Design Phase
I usually design creatures and character but this time it was really fun to try thinking of something as aesthetic as a women’s jewel.
Right after the idea stage I started with rough sketches and thumbnails.
As a 3d artist I believe a design is not thoroughly figured out and completed not until it is realized in 3d. So I did 3d mockup models based on the three sketches I liked the most. The 3d mockups help to see the design from all angles and to spot out any problems and to evaluate it whether it will be hard to 3d print, whether the actual molding process will be possible or complicated.
After I narrowed my choice and focus on only one design that I think is very effective and at the same time easy to produce – I did a second stage of concept design – several variants of the same thing trying out different shapes and motives. Usually I do this by overpainting a screenshot of the 3d mockup model.
Then I created the final 3d model following the refined design and make it 3d printable.
Prototyping Phase
As this is a design for a physical product I didn’t want to stop at the digital stage. There is no better evaluation tool than having a 3d printed model in your hand. I contacted a local 3d printing service and few days later I received the test models I send them. I tested different sizes, versions with cutouts or with no cutout parts and different depth.
I didn’t want to call this done (since it was so fun and exciting to see the design coming to life) and took the decision to manufacture it for real. Make it real or go home (bro! :D). So I did a silicone mold using the 3d print.Then cast it from wax and post-processed it a bit. Finally I and gave it to a friend, who was able to cast it from silver.
Best Phase
The best part of this whole new and exciting experience for me was the photo shoot … where the gorgeous model Aneta wore my design around her neck! :D
Outro
It was a really fun and wonderful experience and I enjoyed every single step from design to rapid-prototyping to molding and presentation.
This is my first ever jewelry design, but I liked the process so much in fact that I think it won’t be my last one! I appreciate your time. Thank you for reading this presentation.

Though, not all woman shows their emotions publicly, they are said to be weeping inside their heart when they get over whelm.

Story Behind:
 The rose has 4 different colors (red, white, pink, blue) with a unique meaning of each. Red is the most popular one as we know. It shows love, respect, passion and courage which are the usual traits among woman. Though, we may call it also a white rose if we choose to make it in silver version only.
Design Structure:
 Rose is commonly use in decorations and in jewelry design. But the problem is how will a designer incorporate such common elements into something new and unique. So here it is. I combined it with a contemporary style of design placing the rose beneath the center of the piece. Simple and plane looking design of the top piece helps the rose stands out even more than just the flower only existing in design",11693,Lomell Rueca

0,4796,Water Drop Collection - Pendant,"Before I started to design this jewelry I had to consider all conditions.
First of course was ELLE style, what it exactly means. It should speak to feminine, positive and self-confident women so I started from this.
Self-confident – When I am thinking about jewelry for this kind of woman it means for me that it should be conspicuous, so quite big, massive.
Positive – it means that it can not be too massive and big, so I should make something interesting for this conspicuous effect, something more gentle.
Feminine – it means that it should show and emphasize beauty of woman. For this purpose jewelry should use smooth shapes (for me it works better than other kind of shapes).
Because it should be in ELLE style, there was also one more condition – it should be completly different than anything before.
Last condition was that it should not include a stone in the design.
After that I could start making drawings.
In sum it should be conspicuous, but in very gentle way, emphasize the beauty of woman, has smooth shape, has no stone and be completly new, and of course be easy to produce. OK – that is nice challenge.
I decided to use two kind of gold. After many drawings I decided to make collection with main theme – drop of water. Why this kind of theme? During drawing there was a little rain outside and I thought that I will try with this one. I drew a few concepts and I decided that it works perfect for me. Drop was made from white gold, rest from yellow. I made ring, pendant and earrings. To show what kind of effect is given by a full collection I attach a picture of all designs together.
All parts are easy to print and later easy to make wax models for bigger production.

A backstory up to the bracelet:
Weeks prior to discovering this contest, I was sketching out these little rings and bangles, just for fun. I never did anything like that before. The practice was highly therapeutic. The moment I saw an email alerting me to this contest, I was excited, and made pages of designs. My jaw would drop every time my eyes looked at what appeared to be ""simple"" jewelry, it was so exciting that jewelers should be so skilled at something as ""seemingly simple"" as line, shape and form...it almost comedic!
I came to understand that the master jewelers deeply understood the *WHY* behind the art of jewelry, as it involved hours of lecture, communication, a library of books...studies of shapes, patterns, psychology, symbols and their meanings. Perhaps it's easier than I realize? Right brain love? Nonetheless I'm just happy to see a line turned into some cosmic shape.
Intimidated? YES!!! But the process was worth it, and I had to try!
Originally, I had sketches with the moon as a primary theme, as a pendant. I think the bangle has done better justice.
The WHY:
The process was arduous. No pattern in my mind, sketched, and modeled could justify how important it was in making the perfect bangle. There were far too many variables for me to understand, but what I did understand, and what was easy for me, was just to keep it simple, and use the importance of the word to evoke meaning. I understood, from observing Elle, that it was important to AUGMENT the physical and mental attributes of the wearer themselves, not divert from them.
Also - jewelry can be a token of power, a talisman, something dear to the wearer. Hence the message. An ordinary bracelet to be worn with others...or so it seems.
Through introspection and the will, to acquire knowledge, and having the strength to carry it out in the face of opposition - I wanted this to be conveyed. I want to see women (and men!) surpass and triumph in their darkest moments - if this bracelet can aid in that desire, then my job is done, bangle is a go.
It is not the best design, but I know at least to me, it is a valuable one, perhaps one that will be improved upon in the future.

To print you can use your printers standard or settings or to get a bit of texture leave off the top layer or mess with the bed height to get some different textures and patterns. Change the scale for earrings or other pieces. to make the cuff print the design then use hot water or a heat gun to shape it to your wrist. 
If you Print in pla you can go to a foundry and burn it out. It will shrink a bit with this around 5% depending on metal mix. Also you can eletroform over the pla for light large pieces. 
My next design with this line is mixing resin and stone dust for some of the holes. Some what like the water it store to survive in such a hot climate. Hope you like it. First time using this site.

La femminilità, l’essere donna: questa l’idea di partenza.
Il cambiamento, la diversità e le mille sfaccettature di un essere misterioso e, allo stesso tempo, affascinante sono le linee guida che hanno dato vita ad un gioiello come lo Spectrum.
Un gioiello che diventa simbolo di qualcosa, più grande e più profondo, inesprimibile come solo la sensibilità di una donna può esserlo. Un gioiello che non va semplicemente indossato, ma capito, interpretato, ritmo e movimento si fondono dando vita ad una superficie variabile, ora pacata ora concitata. Sensazioni contrastanti, ma fondamentali, che bene rappresentano la donna e le sue emozioni.
Tutto questo è espresso perfettamente da un anello, simbolo intramontabile di quella femminilità alla quale Spectrum trova la sua fonte di ispirazione.

The shape of the Chinese character for 8 (八) implies that a person will have a great, wide future as the character starts narrow and gets wider toward the bottom.

0,4963,Hidden Pocket,"I love wearing dresses and skirts, especially when going out. However, these clothes often don't have any pockets. No place for money, keys or cards. It's okay if you like to drag a bag everywhere you go, or you have a boyfriend with pockets that volunteers as living bag that also has to go everywhere you want to. But I don't like bags when I'm dancing. And I don't like stuffing my bra with coins. It looks so ordinary, grabbing in you bra to pay for you drink. I even tried putting things in my boots, adviced by a friend. That resulted in us both standing next to the bar, taking of a boot to search for some coins that had bothered my toes the whole time I was dancing. It was not a look I liked. So I designed these hidden pockets, available in two different sizes. The small pockets are hidden under clothing or inside a booth, while the outer part is decorated and looks nice. The large pocket can fit cards, while the medium pocket can fit keys and coins. It's discreet, practical and pretty.",8473,aphne Lamér

The Mine Cart plugs on the top of the motorized train engine so you can make it go on the tracks. Steve and his chest will fit in the cart. You can put any block in the cart. This is a work in progress. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Kh8XZlD6kM Another train to use with Minecraft is an older train made in Germany by Fuller.

The blocks to make the Minecraft Tree I uploaded can be used to build a house for Steve if you print a bunch of them. Each regular block is 1.5 inches. The other blocks are 2 or 3 blocks long and a large block is 3x3x1 block in size. (1.5 inches or 3.81cm) If you want to save time get some wooden blocks to use with the plastic blocks. I am working on a Minecraft house. It will be made of parts that you use to build your house for Steve.,10957,avid Mc

Best to paint the tree trunk before you glue it all together. This tree is scale to the Minecraft figures being sold in stores. I print everything I upload. The new files with 1111 and 222 are made thinner to save time printing. If you are scaling the tree down then use the thicker files. This tree will be 5 blocks high when put together.

0,5038,Stanford Easter Bunny - Voronoi,"Hi all, I needed a cool mesh to test some true voronoi patterns. And in the spirit of Easter; the Stanford Bunny seemed like the perfect subject! The cell-center distribution for the voronoi patterns was generated using charge particle simulations: The particles can move freely within a 1mm thick voxel model of the bunny. They repel and attract each other. And over time they form a near perfect distribution across the surface. Next, the 1mm wide voronoi pattern was generated within the same 1 mm thick voxel model, resulting in round 1mm wires. And finally the voxel model was polygonized using a marching cubes algorithm, and cleaned using VCG lib functions. Stanford_Bunny - Voronoi pattern stl Is based on single charges, producing a smooth distribution and a honeycomb like pattern. Stanford_Bunny - Voronoi2 pattern stl Is based on sets of 2 linked charges, or lines actually. This produces slightly elongated cells. Resulting in a more more crackly pattern. And although it is not a derivative, hat-tip to Roman Hegglin's ""Stanford Bunny Voronoi style"": http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:291323 Happy Easter everyone!

(You may want to put a thin coat of rubber cement on the bottom of the bracket to keep it from rotation when leveling the bed.) 3 - Get a piece of thin double sided 3M tape (not foam tap). you will want one side to stick to the bracket and work the side towards the glass so that it's just tacky and doesn't ad here to the glass plate.

0,5107,Arduped Biped Robot,"After seeing a couple really cool examples of ""four degrees of freedom"" biped out there, I decided that I would make some cool feet and make the robots a bit more creature-like. Current ideas for cool feet are beasty feet, mech-like feet, rock feet.. you know. The preceding examples of this type of robot used the pcb as the mounting point for the servos, and I've made a generic baseplate with room for a mini breadboard or your own preferred platform. I've also added a ""neck"" servo for looking around and ultrasonic sensor for sight. I plan to make a housing and more creature feet for this as there is much potential for customization. The code I'm using is a derivation of the functions and primitives written for uBipedino (tm) by user Ro-Bot-X on the Let's Make Robots site.

Sir Christopher Wren, Surveyor General to King Charles II and the architect of St. Paul’s Cathedral, and his friend and colleague, Dr Robert Hooke, provided a design for a colossal Doric column in the antique tradition. They drew up plans for a column containing a cantilevered stone staircase of 311 steps leading to a viewing platform. This was surmounted by a drum and a copper urn from which flames emerged, symbolizing the Great Fire.

0,5143,Replicator 2 Fan Duct revisited,"I've recently been printing using NinjaFlex (which is brilliant BTW). On angled thin walled prints, the Replicator 2 output cooling fan would sometimes push the filament to the right causing it miss the layer below. I wanted to remedy this by having the air come from both sides. My previous version of the fan duct suffered on some machines by being too low and as it was supported on one side, would hang down on the right. I realised that I could support the duct by clipping it on both sides of the carriage. I started out by making something that would clip on, then I attached it to the fan and then added the air ducts. The first attempt enclosed the heating element too much and was too low. After printing for about three hours, a PLA version of the final design started to soften in the middle which meant that the clips at the sides became loose. I reprinted it in T-Glass and for good measure, I applied some copper tape to dissipate some of the heat. The one photographed (blue) has printed continuously for 10 hours at 250 degrees (Nylon) and shows no signs of melting. It was cool to the touch when I removed it after the print. I have marked this as work-in-progress as I have only used it for a few days and it may need adjusting. Some air flow analysis would certainly help, but I'm afraid I don't have any such tools :( so I'll have to settle for the empirical approach... Unless you can help? Update I found the airflow from the small holes was too powerful, I've produced a version with wider holes that is more gentle whilst still providing air from 3 sides. Another Update! Fisk4 asked if I could widen it for the people who've bought the Aluminium upgrade, apparently the body is 1.5 mm wider. So I've uploaded a version for that.

Crafts then stood next to the sheriff and read it from the balcony in a stentorian tone. For most people, it was a festive occasion, as about two-thirds of Boston residents supported the revolution.

If your shelf is smaller or larger you might want to edit the .step files and change the angle of the rods. (Sorry, i'm not an openscad kind of thinker, heh) I also wanted a way to easily change spools (I keep my spares bagged up so they do not absorb Seattle moisture.)

0,5246,Linear Bearing Y Axis Carriage for ToM,"ToM Y Axis Carriage for Linear bearings LMB6UU (3/8"") This is really just a little project that I've been fiddling with over the last few months when I have a moment to spare. Purely for my own enjoyment (yes, I know, I should get out more), but you are welcome to try if you wish. I'm sure there are a whole raft of engineers ready to tell me that this is wrong in so many ways and I look forward to being enlightened by their candid observations and everyone's improvements & modifications. For anyone who'd like to try it, it really is a work-in-progress and although it works quite happily at 50mm/s feed rate, it is not yet what I would consider finished. This version requires an X carriage of its own because I've centred the X pulley. As it sits lower on the rods, it gives you > 126mm on the Z axis, so you'll need to place your HBP very high to stop the Z stage falling off the lead screw. (I'll make it ride higher in the next version which will give the stepper more clearance over the bed as well). I should have moved the Y limit switch but to save any hassle I added a long arm to the centre section that operates it in its current position. I also think the X limit switch should be moved to the side of the carriage to clear the pulley bolt. I ended up using 4 bearings although I started out with 3. The inertia of the motor side is too great for the bearings on the right to stop the carriage twisting, I think I may try moving the motor to the right and go back to 3 in a later version. I also intend to move the bearings closer together and remove more material from the base of the carriage to make it lighter. I'll post some photos of it installed when I get a chance.",12852,MakeALot

To protect the surface you can wire brush, annodise and dye....google it. The rudder has a tapered shaft entry, 8mm tapering to 4mm diameter over a length of 60mm. There's also an indentation for drilling and tapping a grub screw but it's better to cut some gripping notches into the SS rudder shaft and cast the aluminium around it. Look up sand casting and get hold of silica sand and bentonite clay, make a moulding box of greater inside dimensions than the fin outside dimensions. Alternatively you can make a mould around it and then cast carbon fibre etc with some low viscosity epoxy resin. Try to find a supplier of infusion moulding resins for best wetting out characteristics. You can also scale the rudder in your slicing program to use in a plane for tail, wing or rudder sections. As a wing, it will provide neutral lift so it's best in an acrobatic plane needing to fly well either side up.",4962,Fluidit

No more giant printing piece - with unsatisfied design! ========== about the bricks : ========== No. 00, 01, 02 is for screwing the tool holder to the wall. No. 03, 04, 08 screw drivers (diameter 4 / 8 / 9.5 mm). No. 05 quick wrench. No. 06 digital caliper. No. 07 scissors. No. 09 nail drawer. No. 10 cutter. No. 11 pliers. No. 12 smooth file. Unit_Yin = slot. Unit_Yang = tab. the width of each block is 15 mm. ================================= It can be very easy to modify the block and add slot and tab part at two sides.

Add a few drops of essential oil to the mix and after a few days your object will smell like that instead of vinegar. Have fun.,11828,an steel

They also blow the cure time out over an hour depending on how much you add...

0,5448,eMaker Huxley modified Z endstop,"This is my first attempt at a modification to my printer and I'm pretty pleased with it. I love printing with my Huxley - http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5631 - but one of the frustrations is the major impact on print quality with even minor variation in the height of the nozzle when printing the first layer. I use spark plug feeler gauges to set the height to 0.2 mm for a 0.3 mm layer height but I found the method of adjusting the Z-endstop didn't give me the level of control I wanted. So I replace the old bracket with a new longer one; I found an old 6 mm hex head bolt with a couple of nuts that fitted; I added a couple of parametric thumbwheels - http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13807; and finally, I designed a new bracket to fit on the side of the X-motor bracket.",11637,Richard Ga

0,5468,Counterpoint,"In music, counterpoint is the overlaying of independent rhythms and contours with the intention of creating harmony in their relationships. Inspired by this principle, this necklace design composes four kinds of elements as the prototypes to express the energy in their relationships.
In the pendent part of the necklace, I focused on designing the interactive relationship of the overall gesture. Each element gradually changes in size and shape while each comes from one of four original shapes. In the parts around the neck, there is one “rhythm” shape that repeats to complete the necklace. 3D printing technology provides us with the chance to produce interlocking parts. I want to explore the aesthetics of using this unique ability to design something that looks delightful, not only in the shapes themselves, but also when the parts involve each other. With this design, I want to express the elements playing together!

0,5469,Mahuika,"Mahukia is the name of the Māori fire deity, whose spirit I wanted to express in the silver reflections, evocative of glistening flames, which are visible in the movable structure of this necklace.
Every element is designed thoughtfully as an individual form and also as part of an overall gesture to be draped around the neck. This necklace intends to show a system for taking advantage of 3D printing technology while treasuring the traditional silver casting and polishing techniques.
The design is composed of linking one-of-a-kind elements which will adjust to the wearer’s body. Because all the elements are separate, they can be cast and polished to a beautiful finish. Additionally, elements can be added or removed to reach a desired length.
With this necklace I hope to integrate the uncompromising form allowed by 3D printing with the passionate spirit of fine silver craftsmanship.
* * * * * After several 3D printed mock-ups and adjusting the form back and forth between the software and physical models, the result is ready to manufacture and wear. How to assemble: (See the uploaded image: Assembling description) Each element has a raised number embossed on the back. To link them together, loop element 1 to element 2, then 2 to 3, and so on until 19 (use -1 to -19 for the opposite side). After linking them, elements 19 and -19 will connect to element 0, completing the chain. How to wear: Unhook the element between 1 and -1. Put the necklace around the neck, and hook elements 1 and -1 back on the necklace again. ( Attending competition purpose. Not for sale.)",14623,han-yin hsu

This item has been the subject of some ""Role Play in Design"" Lightning Lectures in reference to the design process.

Just as it acts as an environmental (protecting from intense sun while providing free air movement) and cultural barrier and shield, the bracer embeds intricate design details that can only be achieved through 3D printing.  The design, based on a 3D scan of the artist and parametrically mapped to the body contours, suggests the extension of cultural place into the fashion of the individual and seeks to explore how culture can update as technologies evolve and the cultures become more global >>> How does one celebrate their culture and heritage in this newly globalize world?

This has been a project I have been working on since I first got my printer. I wanted to develop something that could not be manufactured by any other process other than 3D Printing. I also wanted to make sure that the design was possible to print without the help of supports, as I have found that do not have the patience to deal with them. The most challenging piece to design was definitely the Knight, but I am quite happy with how they all turned out!
The pieces are quite large, so I suggest printing at ~75% scale for most boards. I printed my pieces on a Makerfarm 8"" Prusa i3v in PLA @ 0.2mm layer height. Each piece took a while but it was definitely worth the effort. Enjoy!",8036,BigBadBiso

0,5555,Sintron MK8 Extruder Z-Sensor and Cooling Fan bracket,"A combination of two objects, a z-sensor mount bracket for an 18 mm capacitive or inductive sensor and a 40 mm cooling fan shroud to direct cool air onto the print.  These are for use with a Sintron Prusa i3 MK8 Extruder, but could easily be modified to fit other printers.
The instructions for hooking up the sensor are typically on the side of the sensor itself or in its data sheet. Also be aware that sensors like this come in two flavors PNP and NPN. An overview of what I used also be found here: http://www.instructables.com/id/Enable-Auto-Leveling-for-your-3D-Printer-Marlin-Fi/
Also it depends I suppose on which controller electronics you use.
For a Ramps 1.4, which is what my printer has:
the sensor circuit will probably need the power wire hooked up directly to 12 VDC, rather than the z-axis minimum endstop connector.
the second wire pair containing ground and the wire from the transistor 2n2222, will need to go to the z-axis minimum endstop connector ground and signal input.
Regarding the second fan (and in my case the extruder cooling fan) - it is controlled via the Fan output on the Ramps 1.4 which is D9. D9 is controlled using the G-Code M106/M107 commands in the Marlin or Repetier firmware. This would not be the case if you are using a second extruder heater.
I'm actually not sure how to the hookup in case of a second extruder and its heater. Potentially I guess a person could use 12VDC relays or high power SCRs to turn on both of the extruder heaters together using the D10 output.
One other note of warning, I recently modified this mount to move the sensor to be behind the x-carriage and thus be closer to the center of travel for the x-y plane. Otherwise the sensor winds up hanging over open space when the heat bed was homed on the y-axis, That meant I had to be super careful about the homing order and could never to a HOME ALL command a second time if the sensor was not over the heat bed.
To deal with the above problem of homing, I just posted the new z-axis proximity sensor mount for attaching using screws (two spaced horizontally at 25mm apart) to the back of the x-carriage. Its not a perfect solution either. But it does provide a safer homing order using XYZ instead of XZY.",13573,Scott Lew

0,5633,Taj Mahal - the jewel of Muslim art in India,"The Taj Mahal from Persian and Arabic, ""crown of palaces"", pronounced [ˈt̪aːdʒ mɛˈɦɛl]) is a white marble mausoleum located on the southern bank of Yamuna River in the Indian city of Agra.
It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his favorite wife of three, Mumtaz Mahal.
Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643 but work continued on other phases of the project for an additional ten years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million Indian rupees ($ 501,000 US) which in 2015 would be valued at around 52.8 billion Indian rupees ($827 million US). The construction project employed around 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahauri. The domed marble tomb is part of an integrated complex consisting of gardens and two red-sandstone buildings surrounded by a crenellated wall on three sides.
The Taj Mahal is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and is widely recognized as ""the jewel of Muslim art in India"". It is one of the world’s most celebrated structures and a symbol of India’s rich history. Designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983, the Taj Mahal attracts some 3 million visitors a year.",443,alienkim

0,5675,Parametric Boardgame,"This design is derivative of the game battleship and challenges the notion that board games need a single designer. This is an Open Source parametric game design. The rules change based on the number of players, the desired complexity (depth), and the board shape. I encourage people to come up with their own rules to play and their own Celestial Bodies and Power cards (just be fair). I would also love it if someone could help me model some of the stuff I need to finish the game. (I need connecting and stacking mounts, all of the Celestial Bodies, and artwork for the cards) You use different color 3mm bits of filament as markers and as the pegs found on the bottom of the Celestial Bodies themselves. (The bodies will also have holes in them) The board is generated via parametric script so it can be increased or decreased in size to fine tune your game. I will try to add tabs to it so that we can build non-symmetrical game spaces lego style. The hopeful goal, is to see this game played at hackerspaces and conventions all over. If people like the idea maybe we can start an official League.

0,5677,Arm Mounted Launcher/Pepper Spray/Flame Thrower,This device is derivative of the Hadouken from Street Fighter. It allows a person to have the video game power of throwing fireballs.

THE USE OF THIS DEVICE MAY RESULT IN A DARWIN AWARD USE AT YOUR OWN RISK I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY INJURY OR DAMAGE RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DEVICE IN FACT I DON'T RECOMMEND YOU EVEN USE IT... MOVE ALONG NOTHING TO SEE HERE http://s2.photobucket.com/albums/y44/LinkReincarnate/?action=viewÂ¤t=video-2010-11-10-17-27-20.mp4 Derivative of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4674 Thanks to Sublime for his original Pencil launcher design. This can be strapped to your arm to fire small projectiles or trigger aerosol cans. It is small enough to fit inside of a sleeve. I also remade the firing latch to require more force to trigger. It fires via pullstring. Ideally you would tie the string to a 3d printed ring to place on your finger for triggering. This would ensure that you had to move your hand out of the projectiles path in order to trigger the device. Ie if this is mounted on the bottom of your wrist you would have to pull you wrist back and away from the gun to shoot it ala spider-man. If it's mounted on top of your wrist you would drop your hand away from the gun to fire it.Always use the safety pin from the original pencil launcher to lock the launcher when not planning a shot. MRK 2 Barrel Features Glueless assembly and a reinforced trigger post. Thanks again to sublime for cleaning those latches up for me. MRK 2 Piston features an extended handle for better grip on the safety. MRK 3 Piston features thicker arms for stronger rubber bands and better alignment.,14694,Gamer (LinkReincarnate)
0,5678,Retractible Cord Or RubberBand Battery,A simple pull string mechanism powered via rubber band. The spool posts are a bit long so someone could put a gear on it and use this to power a clockwork contraption or pull string toy. (If you don't need the extra lenth just clip them to size) Or you could use it as a retractable key leash {or lighter leash combined with my bic lighter holster) Also makes a great powered wheel. Just omit the string and wedge the rubber band between the two shells after pulling it through the center spool. Attach the wheel by the posts of the spool and the shell will turn freely around the spool. A good use for this would be maybe a pull car.,14694,Gamer (LinkReincarnate)

I liked this idea but didn't want to have to buy nuts and bolts, but wait I can 3D print just about anything and I figured I could design his bit bracelet to work without the need of support or nuts and bolts. And that's what this design is a single print rotating hex bit key-chain free of support or post print processing! ",957,mtnbiker

you need to print 2 x 'half star' and glue them together, then you can put the star in the hands of the bust (advice : glue it in final position too, but it can stay in the hands without glue..)

From cutting wood and building a naval empire to pumping water and gaining land from the ocean, Dutch engineering and innovation have found clever solutions to national challenges throughout the country’s rich history. Today, Dutch design offers exactly this, simple, clever and often witty solutions to daily problems. The brooch mimics a rotating windmill represented by a Fermat’s spiral, also known as a parabolic spiral. What makes this spiral so aesthetically pleasing is that the angle of succession between rotations approaches the golden ratio. But the main reason for using the spiral isn’t an aesthetic one, by sliding a piece of clothing under its centre and rotating it, the brooch is able to cleverly stay in place without the need of a pin. It can be used as a jacket’s lapel pin, to hold a tie in place or just as an accessory. The S.brooch is simple and elegant enough to be a unisex item, but better yet, it is a conversation piece that could lead to a historic lesson or discussion of what Dutch design and innovation have deeply engrained in its culture and history, and could offer to the United States and the World.",12857,Tr

0,5751,The Flapper,"I've started sculpting base meshes which are fairly generic and can be used a a framework for future models. This shouldn't result in my work looking ""samey"" (well, I hope not) but it will save some time. For this entry, I shall focus on human faces' which unless very deformed (or have non-human elements added), follow a basic rule of proportion. I decided to start with a female head, neck and partial shoulders (what is also known as a bust) as there is a very complicated model I want to make in the future and I'd like to get practised with as many components as I can in advance. The theme I chose for this model is the Flapper. Here is a poem I found which describes the idea fairly well: The New Fashioned Girl Let them sing of the girls of the long, long ago, Who were shocked if their elbows or stockings did show, But I'll chant of the maidens whose ankles are free, To show their half-socks and the shape of their knees, Let them praise those back numbers who turned in their toes And panted and fainted when MEN would propose; Compared to the short-haired, bob-headed fry Who meet all proposals with right to the eye. Let them shed all their tears in a crocodile pour For the simple simp sister who flourished in yore But I'll cast my vote in the way that I feel - For the girl self reliant, bright, snappy and REAL --Unknown You can read about this in my blog: http://www.southquay3d.com/index.php?route=news/article&news_id=17"" This model when fully assembled is 14cm tall.

0,5752,Aria the Dragon,"This was a really difficult model to build and keep support-free. I wanted to see if I could make a delicate and ""Pern-like"" dragon  and I built Aria in Blender, whilst keeping the support-free directive. I also decided to rig her so I could experiment with poses and re-use the model if I wanted to. I should warn you that using rigged models isn't a case of ""just pose and print"" - any high resolution sculpting will have to be completed after the pose is baked (I believe is the term) into the geometry. The temptation is to put your model into an elaborate pose but you will quickly find that the original idea is unprintable and you really have to work the angles to keep the look. I wanted to keep her crouching like a lizard would, rather than the Adalinda model which is sitting flat on the ground. However, to keep her support free, I had to keep her looking up - which I think gives her a gentle appearance. I found this excellent dragon rigging and modelling tutorial series on Blender Cookie: http://cgcookie.com/blender/cgc-courses/creating-... 
It is by David Ward and it's free (yay!) and very useful but it doesn't cover 3D printing considerations (I was on my own there). Aria is my first rigged model and there is no way I would have progressed without the guidance from David's tutorial.

For more information, visit this excellent page
http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/erev/hd_erev.htm...
It is worth researching this style as it is beautiful and striking. To the ancient Egyptians, the scarab beetle was symbolic of the sun (Ra) moving across the sky every day (the beetle rolling a ball of dung was seen to represent this). My model has a stylized beetle with a winged Ra between his two front feet. The model consists of 12 parts which must be fitted together. All pieces print without support.

Unfortunately, any Trick or Treaters who visit a home with a resident Pumpkin Gree will quickly find the joke is on them, as these creatures have great appetite for all sweet things and very little conscience about how they obtain them. Children who complain that their treats have been stolen by a small growling pumpkin will be labelled by their parents as UNTRUTHFUL and GREEDY. The Pumpkin Gree finds this very funny indeed.

Odile is commonly known as the Black Swan, but of course, you can print her any colour that you like. There is a lack of 3D printable swans and definitely those that can be printed without supports - so I made one. Full size she is about 8cm high but scales well.

Here is Adalinda, a female dragon whose song is the most haunting of all. I've had it on my mind for a while to build a dragon, but I wanted to make one that didn't require supports or assembly and here she is. Tolkien style Dragons are not generally shaped to avoid overhang, so the design took some experimentation and thought as I didn't want to compromise too much with shapes. You will need to use lots of cooling when printing her with PLA. With ABS, an enclosed environment is preferred as too much cooling will cause the model to crack I have built her with an open mouth and hollow throat because I wanted her to really look as though she is singing, so don't be surprised at the partial hollow when printing.

Whilst I had originally been happy to use filament swap as a means to change colours, I found this method to be unpredictable when changing from PLA to ABS (the ABS petals ocassionally failing to adhere) and the flowers are limited to one colour only. A re-think was in order and I decided an inlay method would be the best way to go. Not only would it give me the freedom to have as many different coloured petals as I would like, there was the challenge of creating two models which must fit together and appear seamless.

Some time ago I went through a tessellation fad and I made quite a few designs but never had any idea what to do with them - until I discovered 3D printing:-). I dug up a flower design I'd made and set about turning it into a 3D model. Not only is the flower seasonal (and in theory, it's spring time in the UK),but I wanted new coasters for my study and the flower seemed a shape that would lend itself well to being contained in a circle. I have included the following files: 1) A single flower with petal detail 2) A flower coaster 3) A single flower without petal detail (in case anyone just wants the basic shape) If you want to use the coaster on any surface considered delicate, then I recommend you attach an additional base to it and test first. I also suggest you test how well your filament of choice can handle heat if you want to put hot cup of tea or coffee on it. The single flowers if printed out in sufficient quantity and variation of colours, can make pretty toys/trinkets.

This birdhouse features two entrances, upper ventilation through the chimney and windows as well as sloped drains in the base to allow fluid to run out.

Along with the veranda, there are also three perches for birds to hang out on.
There are two hefty center-aligned screw slots for tree mounting and for extra stability, there are two decorative support trusses so keep it from going anywhere!
This classy casa is designed to print without the use of support material. Even the body prints as a single piece! The base, which includes the porch for the veranda, slides in from the front and comes to a rest with the columns mating with the beam of the roof.
I strongly recommend printing in PLA on a printer with a build platform at least 220 mm long and 150 mm wide. Also there are bridges on this model! My original Replicator can handle them just fine so most printers should. They are around and inch long at their longest.

0,5778,Cutting Thread Hobbed Bolt tool V2,"Hobbed Bolt which teeth are cut from the threaded part of the M8 screw have even better grip than tapped one (you can't stop the filament with you fingers). Given that, here it is the hobbing tool. It uses a Dremel drill with a cutting disk of 0.6 mm and a precise position system with 20 steps. The base holds the drill in its purposely designed Dremel threaded hole.
During my tests with hobbed bolt, I figured out that this kind of hobbed bolts tend to push the filament towards the screw threading direction. My new thread cutting tool has the possibility to rotate the screw in order to achieve the right orientation of the cuts and balance the strength component of the slanting thread. It looks that the right cutting angle is about 5° and it is marked with an arrow on the base. Other marks show 15° and 30°.

In one scene, San (Princess Mononoke) chops down a sapling. They appear to crowd around it. Near the climax, when the trees begin to die, kodama can be seen falling from the air and dissolving on the ground.

0,5832,My Neighbor Totoro!,"NOW FREE!
Now you can print you're own Totoro! 
What is Totoro?
He has been called many things from ""a giant furry thing"" to ""a rabbit-like spirit"". Basically, he is a spirit of the forest. Totoro is not a traditional Japanese character: he came completely from Miyazaki's imagination. However, he is obviously a mixture of several animals: tanukis (the Japanese version of raccoons), cats (the pointed ears and the facial expressions), and owls (the chevron markings on their chests and the ""ooo""-ing sound they make with their ocarinas at night).
The name ""Totoro"" comes from Mei mispronouncing (she has a tendency to do so, though it wasn't clear in the dub) the word ""tororu"", which is the Japanese word for ""troll"". When Satsuki asks her ""Totoro? You mean, the Troll in our book?"" she is referring to their book ""Three Mountain Goats"" (The Three Billy Goats Gruff). In the closing credits you can see their mother reading the book to them. Although it's hard to see it on the tape, in the picture book for the movie you can see the picture on the cover shows a goat running over a bridge while a Totoro-like troll looks up from underneath the bridge.

0,5833,Disney's Frozen Elsa,"Queen Elsa of Arendelle (also known as the Snow Queen) is the deuteragonist of Disney's 2013 animated feature, Frozen. She is the older sister of Princess Anna, and the ruler of Arendelle. Her powers over ice and snow ultimately led her to become the famous Snow Queen. She is voiced by Idina Menzel.
Elsa is loosely based on the titular character of ""The Snow Queen"", a fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen, and to a much lesser extent, Kai from the same story. While the character from the original fairy tale was neutral and, to some degree, villainous, Elsa was rewritten as the deuteragonist.

Make something and tag it as a remix! I've included a stl called ""handcut"" that will make the right size holes for the fingers to grab(don't print it, un-manifold on purpose). Sink it in almost to the bottom of the cylinders and Boolean. Smaller parts and those with not much of a footprint could use help from a brim. For me, these were: Cigar, beam, antennae. All other pieces seem to stand on their own. Some of the objects have numbers after their names. These numbers indicate the amount of each piece you will have to print to make one complete model. If you are painting the piece, you can print multiple eyes for different expressions. The body took the longest to figure out. I made it with small tabs at the top and bottom of the door that will need to be cut through with a blade. I made mine serrated and have included a photo to illustrate. I had different parts of the door fuse due to printer settings. If that happens for you, a little work with the serrated blade will open it up. After the door is cut all around, gently pry it open to work the hinges loose. Clean up around the armholes and tabs on the inside with a blade so the tabs are able to be pressed and moved slightly. To assemble the shoulders, press one tab(there are 2) and insert the shoulder into the socket at the same time. The ridges in front and back both need to be set completely into the ring on the shoulder. This will allow the shoulder to rotate with a little tension. Attach 4 links to one shoulder to make an arm. The link2 pieces are the first ones to attach to the bottom of the body for legs as they are angled slightly. Attach 5 links to this to form one leg. If the links don't fit together with a little push, run a blade around the inside hole of the link to loosen it up. Links and hands can be printed with a high infill number to make them tougher. The foot has a hole in the bottom that will fit rare earth magnets if you want to glue one in.",15553,mon kangiser

The gods reigning over their classical pantheon were born from her union with Uranus (the sky), while the sea-gods were born from her union with Pontus (the sea). Her equivalent in the Roman pantheon was Terra.

Generally made out of wood, but also ceramic, it is used to drink the traditional ""Caffè alla Valdostana"" (Aostan Coffee), an alcoholic beverage brewed with coffee, grappa, genepy, dried cloves, orange zest, cinnamon and sugar. Once poured into the cup, sugar is put around the opening and soaked with grappa, then fire is set, in order to burn it dark and sticky. Then the cup is closed with the top, that will stick to the body of the cup. Each friend drinks from a different nozzle, and the cup shall be passed around and never touch the table unless it is empty. The top is decorated with an edelweiss, as it is tradition :) Pouring hot coffee mixed with alcohol in a plastic printed cup is NOT a good idea. This is intended as a decorative item, unless you print it in a heat and alcohol resistent material.",15994,FringeLa

But not only this, they can also be fixed together from all sides to build 3 dimensional structures, similar to construction toys.

0,6281,Mk.V (Okapi) A.M.V.P. fictional armored vehicle,"This is the A.M.V.P. Mk.V (code name Okapi).  This is the latest in the A.M.V.P. family of vehicles including the A.M.V.P Mk III Chinchilla; it has been redesigned to offer a support free print and a snap-together fit, eliminating the need for glue.  I designed it in Tinkercad and printed it using PLA plastic on a Makerbot 5th generation. Printer settings were as follows: temperature 275 degrees, extruder speed 90 mm per second,  infill 10%, layer height 0.2 mm. I used 2 shells.  To assemble the main body of the vehicle, use the flat H-shaped clip  to secure the two hull halves together tightly. The axles twist-lock into the wheels, and the long clips snap to the bottom of the hull securing the wheels and axles: the clips will only fit in one direction following the shape of the hull. The large turret is secured to the back of the vehicle using the rod with a hatch on the end: when the small square extrusion on the hatch is oriented to the side (either direction) the rod will fit through the top of the turret and the hull. To lock the turret in place, rotate the hatch, orienting the extrusion towards the back of the vehicle. To complete assembly of the main turret, push the barrel or extra gun mount into the space at the front of the turret (I found it easiest to point the barrel straight up and push down.)  To assemble the smaller, secondary turret, fit the small T-shaped pin through the base of the turret with the large flat end facing upward, then fit the small gun into the turret slot.  To secure the secondary turret to the front of the vehicle, fit the pin into the provided hole (turret will be oriented sideways to the vehicle) then turn the hull assembly forward to secure. Though the design is intended to for assembly straight off the printer bed, with lower resolution printing, some filing and sanding may facilitate better articulation of moving parts. Features include snap-together assembly, rolling wheels, rotating turrets, multiple elevating gun mounts and secondary turret options available in print. I hope that you enjoy playing with this newest model as much as I have!",10241,.creager

Elsa is loosely based on the titular character of ""The Snow Queen"", a fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen, and to a much lesser extent, Kai from the same story. While the character from the original fairy tale was neutral and, to some degree, villainous, Elsa was rewritten as the deuteragonist.

0,6302,Froggy: the 3D printed ball-jointed frog doll,"Here is my first ball-jointed doll. I have always been fascinated by these but shocked at the prices they command. When the excellent Sonia Verdu uploaded her beautiful Robotica, it inspired me to make my own doll for 3D printing. Whilst Froggy is not a derivation of any of her work, I should give Sonia credit, because if I hadn't had her work to refer to, it would have taken much longer to design this frog.
I made a prototype of Froggy back in February and took two prints to MRRF, where he generally got a positive response. After MRRF, I went to stay with my cousin and his family in Chicago for a few days, where my two ""nieces"" gave me detailed feedback on what they would change.
I returned home and left Froggy alone whilst I worked on other projects but I eventually returned to him and decided to add in the following features:
1) People will try to pose a doll like a human if it looks even slightly human. The original froggy was designed to move like a frog, so I humanised his proportions and movements. He can sit up and stand by himself. His head twists and is angled like a person's.
2) My mum suggested movable eyes, so I thought I'd see if I could do this. Hooray! I could.
3) He has jointed and posable fingers. Sometimes I just like making things difficult for myself:-)
He isn't the easiest model to print and assemble, but I really enjoyed making him.

Plex Tiles consist of a triangular tile and a snap on connector. Once the connector snaps on, they are very difficult to get off, so you don't have to worry about your designs falling apart. Just plan it out, because you may not get them apart again. The base tile has 3 holes and it prints at 2"" (50.8mm). Connect them together to form the main body of the garment. Use the 2 hole tiles for finished edges, like the top of your bag. The strap tile can be used for straps, belts, bracelets, etc. The 3 way connector allows you to drape designs off your main piece or form more complex shapes. It's really up to you.

0,6388,One-piece Ormerod bed support.,"The MDF bed provided with the Ormerod is too floppy and is better replaced with an aluminium one. The problem is the complex cut-outs required (usually laser cut) to fit this on the bed support means that normal people cannot cut this. Therefore I have produced a one-piece bed support with a flat top enabling you to use any bed you wish with only simple drilling which can be more easily done at home. You can even use this support with the original MDF bed if you like by drilling 3 mount holes as shown in the photos and it does support the floppy MDF better. I have done this as I found my aluminium bed too heavy so I am drilling chunks out of it to reduce weight. By making a the bed a single piece I have reduced manufacture time, increased rigidity, eliminated beam/back alignment problems and eliminated connecting screws.",16522,VynZ

Here is a tool that let's you emboss images on to your 3D printed Easter Eggs. Use your own images or find them on the web. It includes ImageToData.exe (for PC) a tool to convert images into a format that can then be used by the enclosed OpenSCAD script to emboss the eggs. You can also emboss spheroids and blimps by adjusting the parameters, or use the code for your own designs. NOTE: There are a lot of sample image maps in the .zip file. QUESTION: How hard is this to use? ANSWER: It is not hard.. You have to edit settings inside of a text file inside of the OpenSCAD envirioment. You don't need to know OpenSCAD programming!

0,6546,Swirling Water Unit - Vortex water nozzle - Vortex Process Techn,"DUE TO AN ALLEGED PATENT BREACH THE STL-FILES ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE, check out http://www.watreco.com/
3D printed nozzle with magnets, creating Vortex water, to restructure the water molecules and thus vitalizing the water? Is it actually working? I don't know but there´s lots of info out there claiming so. I designed this nozzle to raise the awareness for our urgent need for pure water on this planet. If this design works... great fun! If you start thinking about how you can contribute in some way... OUTSTANDING :-)
The information collected here is for educational and entertainment purposes only. It is not to be considered medical advice, prescriptive or diagnostic. See your physician for qualified health care. And I do not claim that this design will work in any special way. I was inspired by the work of many great inventors and researchers like for instance: 
Viktor Schauberger https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Schauberger & Johann Grander https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Schauberger
Why did all this get my attention? Well lots of people claim that the water structure is very important. Like for instance: http://www.fractalfield.com/implodermagneticresearch/LukaszImploderResults.jpg http://stud.epsilon.slu.se/5243/1/vagnell_m_130130.pdf http://www.life-sources.com/pdf/lsi_magnetized.pdf
I also included some interesting youtube videos below. 
So I designed this vortex nozzle to be 3D printed... Now anyone can download, 3D print and test if the alleged benefits of ""living water"" are true or not... (if this design is working that is...) Made 1/2 inch + 3/4 inch threaded parts so that you can use most adapters and hose connectors (for instance 1/2""-M22x1 for the tap). 
Versions with holes can be used for rods/M6 rods as tripod stands in ponds/barrels etc. Alternatively threaded pipes etc can hold the unit directly. 
Also possible to add magnets to test restructuring of the water. Perhaps water ""remembers"" toxins etc and acts like it still is in the water even if filtered out by carbon filters etc. Imagine what that does to the drinking water that circulates back to the tap from the sewers. Magnets might restructure (reset) the ""water molecule clusters"" since the H2O molecule has a negative and a positive side. Lots of people are doing research and it looks like the industry successfully uses water treatment that suggests that it´s a fact... (I will test these magnets: http://www.magnordic.se/shop/gummi-magneter-17x9-... )

0,6547,Floating floor drain cover,"170mm diam, 20mm thick design/logo cover for floor drains This lid floats if water enters the drain, normally it will prevent the water trap from drying out to fast... And it looks nicer than the original Also added a blank cover for you to add your own logo (stl + step) I designed the floor drain cover to be printed with my own conductive ETPU rubber ( http://rubber3dprinting.com/ ) because it results in: • An exclusive look with its matte carbon black surface finish. • A nice print with a minimum of stringy cobwebs (the TPU and carbon black mix makes for a favorable rheology and retraction settings can be optimized). • A cover that will not crack/break when stepped on. • Less energy used when printing since it does not need a heated bed (like ABS etc). To prevent the cover from compressing too much under the foot I made some internal ribs, that way the infill (20%) can still be low and the final part will do a great job as a float. I used a 0.7mm nozzle at 230 deg C for this print. To use a bigger nozzle than the commonly used 0.4mm gives the 3D print so many pros, for instance lower pressure in the melted material -> higher speed. The biggest advantage is the much stronger parts due to the better bonding between the layers (also makes it more likely to be water tight). The conductivity is sometimes a main feature for using the ETPU but in this case the surface finish and ease of 3D printing were the main drivers (the fact that conductivity is not a drawback in this case helped of course). I designed this for a friends restaurant, link to photos I took there: http://palmiga.com/opening-night-2015-httpvastragard-se/ The restaurant: http://vastragard.se/",17574,Thomas Palm

0,6604,Scissor Snake Family,"The Scissor Snake Family
WINNER Second Runner-Up Support-free Product Design Christmas 2014
The ""Scissor Snake"" is a fun 3D printed toy. It is easy to print without support; the ""Scissor Snake"" comes off the build plate assembled and ready to use. Its motion is incredibly smooth, resulting in a very precise, fast, durable and fun remote grabber.
This design uses an exclusive, supportless crossover bearing, engineered for the project. The cross-over bearing interlocks with the frame when fully extended under load, causing the frame to become rigid, thereby reducing stress on the bearing pivots. This results in a strong and durable toy cable of lifting many times its own weight. Kid tested. Guaranteed to provide many hours of fun for kids of all ages.
Buy a 3D printed Scissor Snake here.
Other members of the Scissor Snake Family
Mini - Use as a test print to calibrate your cross over bearing for no fusing and tight motion
Scissor - The Classic scissor snake, easy to print and a good size for kids
Super - Once you have it dialed in, this one can be a lot of fun; it little more challenging to print
Magnum a.k.a. the Trouser Snake - The longest scissor snake in the familiy
Curvy (Experimental, needs tweaking) - Forms an ""S"" curve when extended
Corner (Experimental, needs tweaking) - Forms a curve when extended, to snake around a corner
Instructions
Print at 100% scale, using 30% to 50% infill, no support, at 0.2mm layer height. The ""Scissor Snake"" is designed to print at 100% scale on wide range of 3D printers. However, if the print comes out looser than you'd like, you can reduce the scale by 5 to 10%; this will produce tighter joints. If the print come out too tight, increase the scale by 5 to 10%; this will produce looser joints. Normally this is not necessary. Otherwise, for best results, don't change the scale of the model.

0,6695,Robohand Finger-sensor,"Got inspiration from all the different 3D printed prosthetic hands and was thinking my conductive TPU rubberlike filament could add a dimension or 2... This dualstrusion will create the finished finger with joints and a force sensitive fingertip. The fingertip has a outer shell that, when pressed, will connect to the inner conductive surface, thus creating a closed circuit. This model is only a quick proof of principle design... and the picture of a full hand is only a visualization of a hand that could be printed in one go... perhaps!? Are you up for the challenge? The smudging of the conductive material resulted in a closed loop at aprox 8.5k and when pressing the tip it goes down to 7.2k Its my first dualstrusion, I used 0.7mm nozzles and I could for sure need to adjust the height of the nozzles and it would be great to have retractable nozzles to get rid of the smudging... I designed the finger in a straight shape but it would be better to print it bent outwards, the TPU material has a problem to bend the finger all the way back after it has been closed lots of times... or change the shape of the joints... 3D printed with ABS and with this conductive TPU material: http://www.creativetools.se/pi-etpu-95-250-carbon-black-1kg-se http://rubber3dprinting.com/ http://www.palmiga.com Follow on Instagram and twitter: http://instagram.com/rubber3dprinting https://twitter.com/rubber3dprint http://youtu.be/5Bmg8tpI6Lk http://youtu.be/_7pgMqtvkug https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9NCSGdXK8U",17574,Thomas Palm

0,6723,Party Popper Cannon / BB Gun,"This beauty is a deadly little design that takes regular party poppers and turns them into ferocious firepower. It works by inserting a stripped down party popper into the back of the barrel of the cannon and loading a BB bullet into the front. When you pull the party popper string it sends the BB flying at incredible speeds and distances (~ 15 metres).
To prepare a party popper for use all that needs to be done is to remove the contents of a party popper excluding the popper string and charge.

0,6785,Slider Puzzle. 3x3.,"The classic 3x3 slider puzzle to test your skills and patience. As you can see in the photo I suck at puzzles and cant get the last two numbers. Hopefully you can.
Print the frame and the number blocks. I have included a normal and mirrored versions because for some reason my printer printed the normal as mirrored and vise versa so you will have to see which one your printer will do correctly. Just print one of the number blocks and see how it comes out then use the appropriate files. After cleaning up the print slide the blocks into the frame and push the end frame on. look under the two frame pieces and you will see a small divot at one corner. Make sure these are together when pushing the end on. Check that the blocks slide freely. If not make sure all the support is removed from the corners and under the tabs. Smoothing the block sides with some fine sandpaper helps as well. If the end frame does not fit tight enough put a drop of superglue on the tabs. Print at 0.1 layers, 3 perimeters and 50% infill. Set support for everywhere for best print. Be careful removing support from the blocks so you dont break the edges. I used 3.5mm spacing and 1 interface layer and it came apart ok. Use a different color filament for the blocks and highlight the numbers with a felt pen. Scramble the numbers then try to arrange them in order from left to right. Good Luck.",14881,mybrainhurt

0,6839,TAZ hexagon Hotend 40mm Fan Mount,"Update 5/31/15 This is the final version. My machine has been happily printing for a full week with zero issues. Update 5/24/15 With feedback I made the open end of the funnel section larger so it covers the bottom part of the heat sync. Have mine up and running today, so far so good but have not pushed it yet. The original fan is only 0.57cfm while the new one is 4.83cfm, big difference. I have seen the problems people have with heat creep since the TAZ printer started using the Hex hotend. It's caused by that tiny fan not being able to keep it properly cooled for long prints. So I decided I would tackle the issue by making my own mount. Now, I have a TAZ 4 with the Hexagon Hotend upgrade and that is what I designed this for. I am not 100% sure it will fit on the TAZ 5 but I think it will. This did take 8 hours of design and around 5 prints to get it right. I don't have my fan yet (should be here tomorrow) but I am fairly confident this will work properly. I wanted to stick with the 5v fan since the wiring is already there. I also wanted to find the best fan I could get that would not be noisy and would last a long time. I did a lot of searching and decided there was one great choice, a Noctua NF-A4x10 5v fan, this brand came highly recommended by some high end computer builders, they called it ugly since it's brown and off white but that is the signature of Noctura and they are not from China but Austria I got my for $14.89 off Amazon. The fan shroud fits around the cooling fins by friction but also has a single bolt mount using the existing hotend bolt. Please let me know if this works on the TAZ 5 or TAZ Mini is you decide to use it. Remember this is a work in progress, this might end up being the final design but I won't know until I have fully tested it.",15527,Terry Morr

Boxes I found here were too short and I never designed a sliding top box myself so I figured it was time to try and first rendition worked perfect. No support needed. Lid has an indent on one end to make it easy to open.,15527,Terry Morr
0,6845,Simple DVD Wall Hanger,Just print solid (may need a wide brim to stick) and then use the 2 screw holes to mount to wall. Holds DVD's with or without protective slip covers (some have a cardboard slipcover that may be collectable). Also holds console games. Print is 252mm long so be sure your printer can print it. It might fit smaller printers if turned 45 degrees,15527,Terry Morr
0,6846,Hoodie string toggle,"I got so frustrated when my hoodie strings pulled out for the umpteenth time. It seems they do it no matter how many knots I tie in them. So I created these ends. After some searching I found they are called toggles. Pull your string though, tie a knot. It's that simple. My hoodie has the wide flat string but I think these will work for most as it has a 6mm hole.",15527,Terry Morr
0,6847,Pringles Can Straw Dispenser (for big printers),"Good straw dispensers are expensive and most break easily. So I decided to make one out of a Pringles can. The main bar is a good 245mm long so you will need a large prints, it may fit your printer if you turn it 45 degrees. I printed on a TAZ 4 with ABS and used Acetone to glue up all the parts.",15527,Terry Morr
0,6848,Kokopelli native american statue,Printed as 2 pieces for ease of printing then simply acetone together (or glue if PLA).,15527,Terry Morr
0,6849,Jumbo Glue Stick Mount for TAZ or others with 20mm extruded fram,So I now use the purple Elmers glue stick for my print bed and I bought these jumbo ones (takes less time to apply). This mount is a simple press fit into the slot on the extrusion (it's nice and tight on mine). Just clip a few glue sticks to it so you don't have to look for them each time.,15527,Terry Morr
0,6850,Dremel 36 Bit Holder Grid.,"I have a lot of Dremel bits (1/8"" shaft) and I was trying to find a better mobile storage method. I got a plastic toolbox and I printed this matrix to hold the bits white the rest of the stuff goes in the top of the tool box. Magnets will be inserted to hold the bits from falling out when (not if) the box gets tipped over. Holds 36 bits.",15527,Terry Morr
0,6851,52mm filter adapter for GoPro Hero 3 (for bare lens),This adapter allows you to use any standard 52mm filter on your GoPro Hero 3 lens (without the waterproof case). It simply presses on the lens (snug fit but I would not use it for extreme sports as it might come loose) and screw in your favorite 52mm filter. The filter I have shown on mine is a blue filter but probably most popular would be a polarized filter.,15527,Terry Morr
0,6852,TAZ 4 LED Magnetic Strip Mount,"Just got my TAZ 4 printer and while I desperately want LED lights like I had on my old printer (makes viewing printing much easier and clearer) I did not want to start modifying my machine just yet (under warranty and all). So I took advantage of the modular mount they designed for the extruder. It has 4 bolts (see photo) that made a perfect place to slap some magnets on. Also the LED strip I happened to have was 24v (same as the system) and so I am hooking it up in place of the fan. I print mostly ABS so I removed the fan, if I ever print PLA I can just remove the LED's and put the fan back on in a minute or two.",15527,Terry Morr
0,6853,Cookie Fork,"No mess cookie dipping fork. Simply push the fork into the creak of the cookie and dunk in milk. Then simply eat of the end of the fork and repeat until box of cookies is empty.

0,6854,My Latest GoPro Tripod Mount,"I make a lot of GoPro mounts and accessories and this is my latest tripod mount. It's been updated for maximum strength with wider yet perfectly fitting fingers. The mount has an inset for the GoPro bolt to seat perfectly. The bottom requires a 1/4-20 nut to be epoxied in place, it's also good to epoxy an acorn nut in place for the GoPro bolt. Print this solid for best strength. No support is needed for most printers, you may need minor cleanup of the holes.",15527,Terry Morr
0,6855,Circular Card Holder,I took the original and flip it to the proper orientation for printing and I removed the initials in the center. This is the 1.5mm slot version that prints very well with filament printers since the smaller gaps may have closed up on these printers. The original can be found here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:130119,15527,Terry Morr
0,6856,Gun Cylinder Pen / Pencil Holder,Based on a novelty sold by Think Geek. Looks like an oversized revolver cylinder but it is a pen holder.,15527,Terry Morr
0,6857,"""Do Not Lose"" key fob",Made this for my dad's shop where they keep losing small keys for towel dispensers and such. The red was just painted with a paint pen.,15527,Terry Morr
0,6858,GoPro handle,"This is 2 parts to make printing easier. I make a lot of GoPro mounts but I was never 100% happy with them, too tight, too loose, holes too small.... So I completely redesigned this one and I may be updating my other models with this connector. Also, I found something important for printing thin walled items like the GoPro mounts (fingers), it's important to only have 2 perimeters and then 100% infill. I use to print with 4 perimeters but it turns out that is way too weak because of layer adhesion. See this thread for the full story http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?262,357700",15527,Terry Morr
0,6859,GoPro Coolant Line Mount,"This is for the end of 1/4"" ID Loc-Line Any-Which-Way Coolant Hose. It makes for a great clamp mount for GoPro cameras.",15527,Terry Morr
0,6860,Large Label Peeler,"I put this as a derivative even though I made it from scratch, I made it because I liked the Ultimaker idea but I needed for much wider labels (some of my labels are up to 80mm wide) and I felt it did not need to be as deep and such as theirs, I also added a ledge on the back for clamping it to the table with a spring clamp, you could also drill a few holes and bolt it down. I use a Primera LX400 label printer and make several sizes of product labels on a regular basis. This unit will work with up to 88mm wide labels. I kept printing in mind and it will print without support. My printer did it with near zero cleanup, only a 2 tiny strings from the bridge that were easily removed. P.S. this thing shows errors that Netfabb won't fix but Slic3r had no problem slicing it so any slicer should be OK 2/9/2015 Added 12cm wide version by request.",15527,Terry Morr

0,6863,Brother PT P700 Label printer label catch tray,"So I just got this printer and I am going to print a lot of short labels, I found that if I was not vigilant they would fall out into my pile -o- crap on the floor and be lost forever. So I designed this little catch tray to catch not only the labels but the little scraps that it cuts.",15527,Terry Morr
0,6864,Paint Pen stand,A simple round stand for DecoColor Acrylic Paint Pens. Holds up to 9 pens.,15527,Terry Morr
0,6865,Hole Size test print,"Most slicers make holes smaller than the actual design for various reasons. This is a chart you can print so you can test fit items before designing the proper holes for it. I made it only 2.5mm thick as there is no need to go thicker like some other test prints I found. Also I don't skip sizes like some others (I.E. 10, 12, 14). This is only round but I may do a square one as well latter. The holes are in 1mm increments from 1mm to 25mm.",15527,Terry Morr
0,6866,Wall Vase,The original was on it's side and a bit complex so I re-made it from scratch in an orientation that will print with no support and sized it to fit in my printer (just under 100mm long). The the same basic shape as the original so I will post it as a remix but it's modeled from scratch.,15527,Terry Morr
0,6867,Rubber foot installation tool,"So I make a product that has a case and these rubber feet that go into holes in the bottom. The feet fit very snug and must be pushed and turned to fully seat them, you can do it by hand but after a few it hurts your fingers so I designed this tool to make it much easier. It's a handle and plate that has a pointed texture to grip the rubber feet. I am sure there may be other uses for it. Tenderize a steak, smash a bug... I don't know... Maybe post your ideas of a good use",15527,Terry Morr

0,6869,Wavy Pendant Bezel Tray,This is a pendant tray designed to add your favorite items into then fill with clear epoxy resin.,15527,Terry Morr
0,6870,Mini screwdriver set holder,This is not simply a gravity mount with oversized holes but rather a press on holder that holds the shafts of these screwdrivers with friction so they won't fall out when it's thrown into a drawer. It's made very specifically for this Craftsman set of jewelers screwdrivers that can be found here: http://www.sears.com/craftsman-6-pc-screwdriver-set-jewelers/p-00941106000P?prdNo=33&blockNo=33&blockType=G33,15527,Terry Morr
0,6871,Star Trek Coaster,"Simple drink coaster with the iconic Star Trek communicator symbol in the center. I made this one slightly larger than my last as I want it to fit my 1 liter bottles of soda. OK, I added a stackable version but you will need support printing it. It's just go an inset in the bottom that allows it to lock into the top of another one.",15527,Terry Morr
0,6872,High Tech Chopsticks with ring to hold them together.,Running out of ideas for things to design I saw some titanium chopsticks similar to these (not exactly the same) and I decided to make my own design. I each sushi a lot so they will come in handy. While designing them I decided they would fit together with bottoms facing each other so I also created a ring you slide on them to hold them together for easy storage and carrying.,15527,Terry Morr
0,6873,Remote Caddy,"In my bedroom my remotes were always getting moved around, lost and more. I wanted to make a caddy that would be strong and durable but use minimal material so this is what I came up with.",15527,Terry Morr
0,6874,"Simple hanging spinner, can be used for hanging basket for loose",This is based on nopheads Sky Hook http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:85 I printed it but first could not get the hook into the bearing and it needed support. So I decided to make my own that could be used inline rather than bolted to the ceiling.,15527,Terry Morr
0,6875,GoPro knob long,I have been asked many times to release this so I finally decided to. It's a GoPro knob replacement for the original long one. You will need to provide the bolt.,15527,Terry Morr
0,6876,Apple Ear Bud Shirt Clip,"If you are like me you need something like this. When I go walking with my ear buds on every time I turn my head one pulls out. For a short time I used a big paper clip to clip it to my shirt but that was a pain to put on and take off. So I designed this device loosely based on a flat plastic paper clip I have seen before. It's easy to put on and remove, it fits the ""Y"" connection on all Apple ear buds perfectly and is low profile, you can barely tell you have it on. And best of all, no more ear buds getting ripped out of my ears when I turn my head.",15527,Terry Morr
0,6877,Nut capture for 8-32 nuts,"Made these for a box I am making, it's time consuming to get the nut hole just right and not many SAE ones here so I thought I would share. The nut squeezes in easy but not so easy that it will fall out.",15527,Terry Morr
0,6878,Lasko mini heater hanger,"So I have a cover for my printer that I made to keep the heat in (to prevent cracking on taller prints). But it turns out that even with the heated bed and print head it was not hot enough. So I got one of these little Lasko electric heaters from Walmart (online not in store). It was cheap (like $15) and it has a fan and no tilt switch (safety for turning over). This is made to fit on a desk at work. So my cover is made of plane old schedule 40 PVC pipe. I tried the heater by clamping the cord to the top and pointing it down towards the build platform and it works great. It gets plenty hot inside now but not so hot as to be dangerous. So I made this hanger so I could quickly attach it and even point it. Print solid (or close, I used 80% infill) and then drill and bolt to the back corner of the Lasko. The holes in the mount match up perfectly with the space between the fins.",15527,Terry Morr
0,6879,Solder Spool holder,Simple design to hold a standard 1lb spool of solder. Glue 5 standard BB's in the divots provided to allow smooth unspooling of the solder. Works without them as well but a bit nicer with them. Print solid as you want it strong.,15527,Terry Morr
0,6880,Small LED Flashlight clip mount,So I am kind of a nut for LED flashlights. I have and have had many over the years. Right now my favorite everyday flashlights are these little 3watt units that take 2 regular AA batteries. Many makes of them but they all have a 3W Cree LED and are 90% the same. Anyway my biggest issue is if you lay them on their side they roll around and off tables. If you sit them straight upright they are easily knocked over. I finally had enough and made this very simple clip mount. The flashlight is easily pushed in and yet snaps in securely. I used only 1 screw to attach as I thought maybe turning it would be handy.,15527,Terry Morr
0,6881,Art Deco Pendant,"It's a little big, but big is in.",15527,Terry Morr
0,6882,GoPro Zip Tie mount 2,So I made a zip tie mount here http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:83689 And I decided to remake it from scratch. This one is open where the zip ties cross and like the other one can be held down by 2 zip ties in either orientation. I think this one is better.,15527,Terry Morr
0,6883,GoPro Hero3 minimal case,"Inspired by http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:76082 This one does not have the top latch that tended to break easy, it also has the side with plug ins fully accessible even the micro SD card can be removed. The case is very tight and has 2 bump rods to assure the camera does not fall out. Printed with .25 layer height, 4 perimeters 50% infill",15527,Terry Morr
0,6884,GoPro Hero single axis gimbal,"So I use a 6' pole to get elevated shots. Problem is the mount is rigid and so the camera angle changes with the angle of the pole. Solution, a single axis free floating gimbal. I printed with 50% infill and 4 perimeters. The pivot point is made for a 8/32 bolt and nut (I use them all day and I don't have any metric). Either leave the nut loose (suggest a lock nut) or do what I did and glue the screws to the inside of the frame, it will not come apart this way unless you pull on the frame wall.",15527,Terry Morr
0,6885,GoPro Tripod mount,My own design of a tripod mount for a GoPro camera. Has a hex hole in the bottom for a 1/4-20 nut and space above that for the bolt. I printed with 50% infill to make it strong and 4 perimeters to reinforce holes.,15527,Terry Morr
0,6886,GoPro Camera 3 point suction cup mount. Hood mount,"I want to be able to put my GoPro Hero on the hood of my car so I can video without seeing my dash, dirty windshield & hood. I just bought my $300 camera and just don't trust their $30 suction mount for this. So I bought 3 RAM suction cups (super strong and reliable) and created a triangle plate to mount them as one. This way, up to 2 can fail and I won't lose my camera. I would feel safe with this rig driving cross country at freeway speeds. On my first version I made the mount in the center and low. Turns out it was impossible to attach the knob and the mount was always visible in the lens. I did use a few extensions to make it work but I knew I could do better. So my second version (this one) addresses this by raising the mount up off the triangle and placing it at the edge. It works great.",15527,Terry Morr
0,6887,GoPro Hero3 lens cover,Just a lens cover for the GoPro Hero3 series camera. Just for preventing damage to lens when not in use.,15527,Terry Morr
0,6888,Drawer Label Holder,"I made these for my Akro-Mils plastic drawers but they may work with others. This is simply a holder so you can drop a paper in it displaying what's in the drawers. I have well over 120 drawers with jewelry supplies and adding more all the time so I wanted an easy way to add a quick tag. Print on a paper strip that is 2"" x 7/8"" and it will slide right in. Now these drawers are made of HDPE and is near impossible to glue to. So I use a clear (red liner) double sided tape called VHB (Very High Bond) Acrylic adhesive. It's similar to the tape used to put rubber or plastic moulding on the side of cars (as well as car make emblems).",15527,Terry Morr

0,6890,Eye Glasses Shirt clip,"I was always dropping my glasses when hooked in the neck of my shirt. This thing will prevent this. You need a large ""fender"" washer and 2 small strong magnets. I built in support for the middle bridge as I did not like the support that was generated in Slic3r.",15527,Terry Morr
0,6891,Anti Splatter paper bowl cover,"When heating up soup or canned meals in the microwave I always covered them with a paper towel to prevent splatter (covering the inside of the microwave with bits of food). The problem is that many times the paper towel dips down into the food soaking it up and making a mess. So I designed this to solve the issue. It covers the paper bowls while still allowing hot steam to escape. If the food splatters, just rinse it off in water.",15527,Terry Morr
0,6892,4 leaf clover,Wanted to make a clover necklace for my cousin. Rather than just making it flat faced I made it with the center inset to it's framed. After printing I decided to fill the middle with doming epoxy (that's what I sell for a living) and I think it looked pretty good. It will look good without the epoxy as well. Could also be used as a keychain.,15527,Terry Morr
0,6893,Chili's pendant for necklace,"My second cousin works for Chili's so I thought I would maker her a pendant (actually her moms idea). I did put filler on it, sanded it and painted it so it's smoother in my photo than it prints.",15527,Terry Morr
0,6894,Klingon Bat'Leth,"I could not find one here so I made one. Klingon Bat'Leth right out of Star Trek. Update I really wanted a smooth surface. Well I sell doming epoxy for a living for doming name badges, jewelry and promotional items. I decided to dome the Bat'leth, it looks killer with the clear dome and the silky smooth surface but you can still see the print marks so I also did one with silver paint. Now it looks more like the real thing (only much smaller). Still need to get some leather lacing to make the grips. New photos added with the epoxy and paint.",15527,Terry Morr
0,6895,Babybel Cheese holder,"I am a fan of these small puck shaped cheese disks so I decided to print a stacking holder for them. These cheeses come in a pack of 6 so I made this tall enough for that. My printer was not tall enough to print it in one shot so I divided it into 2 pieces that can easily be glued together. I originally designed it to hold them with the cellophane in place but after I made it I found my next batch of cheese would not fit as well, there were variations on the cellophane wrapper. So instead just remove the cellophane and put the bits in with just their wax shell on.",15527,Terry Morr

These are used for model making, headlight restoration, guitar restoration, Polymer clay and much more. I have been using them to sand my printed Star Trek badges.

0,6898,Car Cup Holder Adapter,"My car's cup holder was made for very large cups only and has open sides meaning anything smaller (fast food cups, bottled water...) just falls over when taking a turn. The inner walls are slightly tapered in to form fit fast food cups. So I designed this adapter. Works great with all but large drinks which work OK without the adapter. Since it has walls all around even smaller items can't tip over. Could also be used to hold keys, change or a cell phone.",15527,Terry Morr

Leaving all files attached so you can mix and match what you may want to use Testing with solid blocks, hollow blocks where you can see through and also ones where the letter is only slightly indented into the front. Update: Settled on hollow blocks with the letter embossed in on the front, this seems to be the easiest to print without support and minimal material. Just print one of each letter (and two 'S') in the picture I scaled things up to 1.2(120%) as they were a bit small. Then print out the roof's. The one with the chimney can be printed 'flat' as the pitch is 45 degrees it shouldn't need support. Will post picture once set is printed",18306,Pierce Ferriter

0,6929,Ninja Feet for Printrbot Simple Metal,My Printrbot Metal Simple used to wander aimlessly around the desk. The desk also acted as a resonance box. So I designed these little feet/shoes/pads and printed in Ninjaflex and ever since then it stays put and is quieter.,18347,mgx
0,6930,Z-stabilizer for Printrbot Simple Metal,If your Z axis oscillates/vibrates you can use this little bracket to fix it. It is designed to travel freely along the z axis (before using please test and make sure it doesn't lock/bind on the screw or on the rods).,18347,mgx
0,6931,Printrbot Cable Straps,"Printrbot Metal Simple is a great little printer, but it has this small issue where one of the cables occasionally gets tangled in prints. So I spent maybe two minutes in 3D Builder to design a ring that slides on the Z axis and pulls the cable up with a rubber band. People in the office saw it and started asking for the design, even suggested I upload it to Thingiverse. I refused uploading such a trivial thing but, later on, I had people coming back asking for rubber bands. Yes, apparently there is a shortage of rubber bands in the world ?! Now that is a problem worth solving, so I set to design a version for Ninjaflex (yes, amongst 3D printing folks Ninjaflex might be more common than rubber bands). In order to print this version on the Metal simple you need the Adafruit adapter (337267) and for the Microsoft Slicer you will need to edit the settings here: C:/Windows/System32/spooldrivers/x64/3/PB_3DPrinterDeviceConfig.xml (yes, there is a built-in slicer coming with the Printrbot Driver in Windows 8.1 and can be tweaked quite a bit). Ok, I'll admit the Ninjaflex is not that easy to print, so I figured I should also try a PLAin PLA version. That turned out equally functional and maybe better looking than the other two. Enjoy!",18347,mgx
0,6932,Square Extrusion Clamp,"This clamp joins OpenBeam/Misumi 1515 extrusions at a 90 degree angle. It is meant for axial and radial loads, it will probably not do a good job for angular loads. Additional parts needed:",18347,mgx
0,6933,Semi-automatic Bed Level Probe,"This is a simple, micro-switch based bed level probe that costs less than $1 to make and gets the job done, reliably. Is is semi-automatic, in the sense that you attach it to the extruder, run the calibration routine (G29 in Marlin or G32 in Repetier) and then remove the probe. That means it does not add any weight to the print head, a nice plus for Delta or Bowden based printers. As long as you don't bump the printer or change the bed plate, the re-calibration is not needed. It was designed to be quick-mount: it slides right on the effector plate on Kossel (8mm thick one) and it takes only a few seconds to mount on other plates that are 8mm or less. The jaw is adjustable and tightens for increased repeatability. In terms of height it should work for any hot-end that is less than 65mm in total height from wherever the probe attaches, which means both the j-head and the longer clones will fit just fine. In terms of accuracy: I get a 20 micron repeatability but I can't say how much of that is because of the printer vs the probe vs the switch, the bottom line is all of those combined are less than 20 microns which is more than sufficient for most prints. NOTE: If you are discouraged by manual probes and still waiting for that fully automatic sensor you might be surprised to how much of a difference this little thing can make: consider this will at least allow you to get the printer in a shape where it can actually print parts for a more complex probe. This should be lot more precise than the Kossel original allen key probe and more reliable than the newer FSR solution (at least for the time being) in the sense that it allows you to have a heated bed as well as a super-tight bed plate (safe removal of stubborn prints). The large version is compatible with both 1/2"" (small) and 20mm (large) micro-switches. Additional parts needed: Note: Height maps generated with Repetier (Tools->Bed height map) and Excel.",18347,mgx

0,6937,Tree Top mount,"Turns out putting the tree top (Christmas Tree Star) is a real problem these days. Our first tree top mount cracked. Bought a second tree top, this one did not come with a mount at all. The third one came with a mount that was way too big and stood out. Interestingly enough all these tree tops attach with a 5/16"" (8mm) rod, so here comes this little adapter: at one end it has an 8mm hole where the tree top goes. The hole is slightly tapered to make up for variations in the rod diameter as well as tighten well when you press the top in. At the other end it has another conical hole - from 8mm (5/16"") to 15mm (9/16"") diameter, this end goes on the tree. There is also a cut here to give it a bit of elasticity.",18347,mgx

0,6945,Poly Pencil Holder,"So after I got my printer, I figured I'd make stuff for the desk at my new job. I made a few basic shaped pencil holders at first, which you could find at my thingiverse page, and then I decided to spice it up with this design. The modeling of all my pencil holders are pretty simply, just a repeated spiral pattern. I noticed how cool this looked when experimenting with different spiral cross sections when starting the model. I'd consider this the 2nd stage of designs so maybe I'll have a better one later...
I'd recommend printing at about .25-.3 layer height, concentric layers, lower range of temps, and lower speed to reduce the stringiness cause if it's stringy then you have to removed the strings in the holes. I tried using a lighter to remove the strings, but beware that it can burn the print color.

0,6982,OpenRC Quadcopter (Beta),"This is a first go at a OpenRC Quadcopter. Eventhough i have now abandoned this design i have put to much time in it not to release it so here it is. My goals when starting was to create a different design than what we usually see for 3D printed quads and enclose all electronics in the design itself. The idea was an experiment to create parts from a strong material with thin walls and low infill to keep the weight down. Everything is designed to fit the electronics from a DJI 450 Flamewheel. As you may have noticed i call this a ""Alpha"" verion and that is becasue it´s simply not finished. While all parts do fit together there are things missing in the design. Hopefully someone can get something out of this project, maybe use parts of the design or it can spark ideas for new projects.

0,7103,3D Printed (Sun) Glasses for Children,"This design is developed for 3D printing glasses/sun glasses for children (sizing approx.: 42 – 14.5 – 109 – 25). Note, the design can be scaled and reoriented for adult head sizes, which is featured in the images (if this is done, the lenses should be repositioned in the frames to ensure a fit). This design is meant to act as a contribution to making and donate to a global need. It is free for all and is meant to be utilized in developed and developing countries where 3D printing might enable the production of items that enhance the daily lives of many. This is meant to push the agenda for democratizing design and suggests/encourages designers to contribute beyond their own needs and desires.
Included in the design are the frames and the lenses. Each will need to be 3D printed to enable the manufacturing of functioning glasses (either prescription or not). The design is noted as sun glasses since the proper fitting of glasses with prescription lenses requires expertise outside of the designer’s skills. 3D print the lenses and these can be taken to any lens manufacturer, scanned and reproduced via CNC in actual lens material. If these services are not ready available, the 3D printed lenses can be sent to someone with that capacity, however prescription fitting puts the focal point of lenses in specific locations, be aware of that.
Please be cognizant of materials used in the making of glasses. Since these come in contact with the skin, ABS is an inappropriate material for functioning use since it’s composite anatomy are known toxins.

0,7112,OpenRailway EMD SW1500 1:32 Locomotive,"The EMD SW 1500 is a American diesel switcher locomotive made by General Motors' Electro-Motive Division during the 60's and 70's. Some 800 were made and there are several still in serivce in the United States. 
This 1:32 scale version of the EMD SW 1500 locomotive is part of ""The OpenRailway Project"" which is a Open Source initiative to bring more free model trains to the world. While having done several different 3Dprinting projects in the past i needed something with a little more attention to detail to 3Dprint. Since me and my dad had already built a garden railway (scale 1:32) it felt like a good idea to go for a train. I went to a model train store in Stockholm to discuss what train that might be suitable and after two or three cups of coffee i decided on the EMD SW1500. 
Design work began by searching for specifications, drawings and pictures. While i didn't have very much luck finding the kind of drawings I initially hoped for (I did find a few) I had to rely heavily on different photos hence some details may be incorrect. Everything is 3D-printed but the handrail which is made from 1.5mm Aluminium welding rod. The are some details that need attention but basically you can print and assemble everything if you want to own your very own 1:32 SW1500. 
If you want to know more about The OpenRailway Project read this article by 3DPrint.com.

DESCRIPTION 
CLICK HERE & READ THE MANUAL BEFORE PRINTING 
I designed the hand using ABS plastic the more infill the stronger the hand but the longer the print time. The entire hand will take approximately 18 hours in total and cost about $8.00 in plastic (at 4 cents a gram). All parts were printed on my Up Plus 2 with 14cm x 15cm x 15cm build volume. There are also a lot of metal screws that you need to hold all of the printed parts together. I used sheet metal self tapper pan screws 8G x 9mm.

0,7132,Modified prusa i3 x-carriage with Laser support,"See a full description of the project on Sway: https://sway.com/LqQa1e8HWW4ZqbUk I added a J Tech 2.8 Watt Laser Diode to a Sintron Prusa I3. You may find that mounting the Laser 100 MM above the print bed does not allow as fine a laser as you would like. Optimal is 30 MM, but I wanted to mount the Laser higher and allow both laser and 3D printer to work potentially in conjunction. I planned on moving the level sensor to the back of the x-carriage to be more centrally located in the x-y plane to measure the z-axis limit. I have designed a new sensor mount for that purpose which is also attached. Also note that moving the Z-position sensor to the back of the carriage can limit the Z- movement by some amount - depending on your your printer's frame. In my case that was about 15 MM of Z travel that I lost from the top end. It could also affect X-axis travel, again depending on your printer's frame. Last added picture shows laser cut gear made on 1/8 inch thick Bassword. This took 4 passes at the 2 AMP setting at 50% speed and 1 pass at full speed.",13573,Scott Lew

0,7135,MGN-12H Carriage Loader,This retainer saves time and eliminates frustration when mounting Hiwin MGN-12C/MGN-12H carriages back onto the linear rails. These 12mm linear rails are typically used in Kossel based printers and although the carriages have a wire retainer it does not do a good job in preventing the balls from escaping. Note: The no-name carriages vary wildly in dimensions (I found a difference of almost 0.5mm between two carriages in the same set) so you might have to scale before print. This part is designed to have 9.25mm clearance between the retainer wires.,18347,mgx
0,7136,MOAB - MOther of All fan Brackets,"An easy way to generate brackets to attach any fan to any PCB board. A list of pre-defined brackets included. The script was initially meant to generate fan brackets for the RAMPS board but I decided to make it fully customizable: it now allows you to create brackets that take fans of any size, snap onto PCB of any size, can have any height, but probably best of all features is that you can generate both mini-brackets (2 holes) as well as full brackets (4 holes, fully enclosed on two sides), to balance between saving plastic vs. rigidity and improved air flow. While this was meant for PCBs, feel free to experiment it could probably be used for many other scenarios, for example to attach a fan to a NEMA17 motor or to space two PCBs by attaching brackets back to back, etc. UPDATE : It can now generate PCB supports with no holes (example scenario: Raspberry Pi or Intel Galileo feet). Specific changes:",18347,mgx
0,7137,Simple 60mm fan bracket for RAMPS,"Note: This is deprecated, see http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:166045 intead UPDATE: v2 version (pictured in gray) is slightly taller: 27mm clearance to PCB.

0,7139,Battery Adapter: AA to C,"The adapter allows you to use an AA (LR6) battery instead of a C (LR14) battery.

0,7142,Alien Jungle,"A set of alien flora designed for our 18mm scale Wayfarer miniatures (same models we use for Pocket-Tactics).

0,7163,Lightbulb Mesh Lampshade,"I was almost about to throw out an old Ikea lamp when I realised I could give it a new life with the help of 3D printing. This is a simple design that gives personality to the light, and casts some nice shadows as well. The inside diameter is 34mm so just make sure your lightbulb and socket will suit - although of course you can always just scale the print up or down to suit!

0,7164,Replacement Arms for Sunglasses,"My Aviators never quite fit properly behind my ears, so this is my solution for a more comfortable fit. You can easily make your own for any type of wireframe glasses or sunnies (best for wire arms with a diameter of 1.5mm, although you could scale the print or simply drill the holes out to fit your frames).
Simply cut the arms off, leaving 15mm of length to slot into the holes of the new 3D printed arms. I used Araldite to glue them into place. Make sure you try them on before gluing, you want to get a good angle on the arms so that they wrap around your head behind your ear.

0,7165,Hex Phone Sound Amplifier,"A clean and simple amplifier for your mobile phone. Certainly not a new idea but I needed something to help cleanup my desk and allow me to play music (or just hear the phone ringing from the opposite end of the house!).

A modified version of this won the i.Materialise 3D Printed Wood Challenge (http://i.materialise.com/blog/entry/announcing-five-winners-of-our-3d-printed-wood-challenge)
Check the dimensions of your phone against the slot dimensions pictured - I designed this for smaller phones like my old Samsung Galaxy S2, so you may want to scale up the design prior to printing if you're using a giant phone. Read more about the design of this product on my blog, including the multi-coloured effect created by swapping filament colours during printing. https://edditiveblog.wordpress.com/category/phone... Enjoy!",19460,tiv
0,7166,Beer Bottle Lock,"Firstly let me state this is not an original idea – recently a Beer Bottle Lock made the rounds on 3D printing news sites, stemming from an Instructables tutorial by JON-A-TRON (see http://www.instructables.com/id/Beer-Bottle-Lock/... for the original).
However with Xmas fast approaching I wanted to design one for a bit of fun with my family. Simply print the 2 pieces out and use any small travel lock to secure that final beer (whether it's yours or someone else's!). Unlike the original by JON-A-TRON this design requires no screw. The dimensions are quite loose so that it should securely fit a wide variety of bottle shapes, if you don’t need this flexibility you might like to thicken 1 or 2 areas on the inside prior to printing. Sure it could be snapped off, but this design is really just for a bit of fun - if you're genuinely worried about people stealing beer maybe you need to reconsider who your mates are ;) Follow how this was designed on my blog https://edditiveblog.wordpress.com/category/beer-...",19460,tiv

Either way, take your karting to the next level! You can read about my process designing and creating this design on my blog https://edditiveblog.wordpress.com/category/mario...

This is not just a test piece, but I now use these 3D printed fins on my board. I've been printing them on an 'Up! Plus 2' printer using the 0.15mm layer settings and solid fill for strength. I have also been using a small amount of acetone just to finish off the outside surfaces, but the quality off the 'Up! Plus 2' has been pretty good so you don't necessarily have to do this.

Modular design allows you to print as many sections as you need. Need another octave of keys? Print all you want?  Want 5 modulation wheels? You can do it! This design has many useful features for the DIY synthesizer designer! The front panel has a grid embossed on the back for easy drilling of holes for knobs and sliders; never worry about the drill sliding away from you again! The bottom includes mounting holes for screwing down circuit boards. The edges have grooves in them so that the parts will not jump out of alignment. The whole design is designed to be fastened together at the ends with threaded rods through all of the parts. The parts are currently designed at a very small scale so that you can scale it up to any size that you need. The file ""keyboard6.stl"" is an exploded view with all of the parts, and is only for an overview of the design, not for printing.

0,7329,Pokeball (opens and closes),"UPDATE 08/26/2015 - I made this file ""public"" on Onshape. So if you want to edit it or add new stuff to it you can. Just go to https://cad.onshape.com/signin and make a free account. Then search ""Pokeball by SpragClutch"" in the public area.
UPDATED TO VERSION 2 ON 06/13/2015 
This is a workable Pokeball that opens and closes. It is 3"" in diameter. (7.62 cm) Made it for my nephew. Enjoy! 
This is version 2 (""V2"" in file name). I have printed and made version 2. It is good to go. 
Version 1 is no longer available. But if you happen to have Version 1 (""V1"" in file name), these are known issues, 
1.75 filament fits snug/tight in hinge. On the plus side, once its in it makes a nice solid hinge. I increased the size of the hinge hole in version 2.
""Outer shells"" needs to be manually aligned. And although super glue will work to glue it to the ""main frame"", a thicker glue is preferred. I add alignment slots to the ""Outer shell"" and the ""main frame"" in version 2.
If you run into any other problems or want something else included, please let me know in the comments.

He utilizes a radio encryption decipher backpack to boost his capabilities and it converts into a microwave cannon to fry enemy circuits.

0,7432,My BB Filled LM8UU Type Bearings,"These bearings take 4.5 mm steel BBs. (Copper might work, but I have heard that they may cause problems due to the metal differences.) I printed these on a Printrbot Simple in PLA at .25 layer height and 10% Infill. (I have also tried to print these on a Makerbot Replicator 2 at the Low Resolution with 10% infill, but they had a much lower tolerance. Ie, they turned out very tight and it took a long time to wear the BBs in to their races before smooth travel was possible.) Dimensions: Short: 23 mm High, 22 mm Outer Diameter Long: 48 mm High, 22 mm Outer Diameter Inner holes are 8 mm in diameter. (This should work on 5/16” rods as well.) After printing you may want to use an Exacto knife or 8 mm drill to make certain the hole will give clearance for the rod as the plastic tends to swell into it a bit when printed.) The Combined Version is the same size as the Short with the addition of parts to allow it to be used on a Prusa i3 Rework Y Bed. When assembling the combined version I suggest placing the BBs in the races, placing the top and bottom on a flat surface and then using a clamp to press them together. (Attempting to twist them together may result in breaking the mounting brackets.) The Short uses 16 BBs. The Long uses 32 BBs. I really liked the concept of using BBs for the bearings like in http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:28905, but my attempts to print them out failed. I tried to use Netfabb Basic to repair the file, but still was ending up with 739 flipped triangles. So I began to design this version instead. One of the things I was hoping to do is be able to create a design that could allow me to modify in order to create odd sized linear bearings. Tearing apart inkjets and laser printers I have found many of the rods are 5, 7 and 9 mm sizes which are not typical linear bearing sizes.
