0,246,GuerillaBeam Beta,"This is the old GuerillaBeam projector base unit. GuerillaBeam is not a toy, but a weapon of mass distraction. ""the most powerful gun you are allowed to print""
Current versions: 
v.58 currently recommended standard version
v.57x same, but with a second accessory rail at the top
v.49e slightly older but most compact version
GuerillaBeam features:
brightness and portability
long runtime
great image quality (depending on lens and light)
short bill of materials, parts are very easy to come by
print your own slides
print your own projector and accessories
By purchasing the GuerillaBeam Beta now, you will also get the 1.0 release version (""GuerillaBeam One"") which I will publish here soon. 
Please notice that your purchase will be under CC BY-NC-SA license, meaning you are allowed to COPY, REMIX and SHARE it as you like, as long as you give credit and do it in a non-profit way.
HowTo:
First, find a suitable LED (flash)light.
the flashlight should ideally project a uniform spot of 45mm (the 35mm slide image area) at the distance to the slide (which is also around 45mm).
Look for Cree XM-L T6 lights with 1000 Lumen (this means two LIIon batteries). XM-L2 lights are even better
a good  and affordable light is the SomeFire X8 (for example UltraFire X8).
Second: you'll need reasonably bright SLR lens (f/2.8 or better). The brighter the better! For starters: just pick any 135mm or 50mm, just don't pay more than 23 bucks.
Third: print adapters for light and lens.
Fourth and final: Just attach lens and a light and project away! (more detailed directions can be found at http://guerillabeam.net)
As time allows and demand dictates, templates for accessories are and/or will be available too, like:
Adapter for M42 and T2 lenses
tripod mount / quick release plate
Adapters for Pentax, Canon EF-S, Minolta, Rolleiflex and others (online soon)
Pistol grip with slide magazine
Flashlight adapters
flash adapter (planned soon)
slide on quick mount plates (online soon)
slide on NATO accessory rail (online soon)
Possibilities are endless, and my pipeline is currently full of ideas. You can also create your own extensions and variants of GuerillaBeam. I will publish all needed schematics. In case you need something specific you can just ask me. I also offer complete beamer sets for all purposes. 
Printing tips for printing with fused deposition modeling
I usually slice with Cura, and print on an Ultimaker Original (0.4mm nozzle) with ~60mm/s in PLA. I recommend 0.2mm layer height, 1.2 mm shells (3 walls) and 13% fill for reasonable printing times of around 4 hours. The base unit will hold lenses over 2kg without problems this way.
You can print usable projectors with 0.5mm nozzles and layer heights of up to 0.4mm, or at insane speeds, but you will have more cleanup work and worse ergonomics then
If you are interested in my current Cura profiles please drop me a line and I will put them online.",590,universalist

0,248,GuerillaBeam Flashlight adapters,"UPDATE 2015-05-03: Updated adapters, new flashlights
This set contains adapters for the following (recommended) Cree XM-L LED flashlights.
TrustFire X8 (most recommended)
UltraFire X8 (quite similar to the TrustFire X8)
TrustFire Z5
SkyRay King (caution: hot, can melt PLA!)
ThruNite TN 30 (brightest, but hot - can melt PLA)
'PedalBeam' bike light (advantage of DC plug, overheats, hot - can melt PLA)
The following prototpye adapters are only included for historical reasons (unsupported):
UltraFire C8 (cheap light, bad projections)
TrustFire TR-3T6 (very large, very hot)
TrustFire TR-J18 (very large, very hot)
These adapters are intended for the GuerillaBeam projector, but you could use them to attach those lights to whatever you like.
Most adapters work the same: They are slightly bent open, and snapped on the front of the flashlight (after removing the flashlight front bezel, if possible). Locking is done by screwing a GuerillaBeam (or a compatible nut) on them. The adapters for the TN30 and the SkyRay King are screwed into the lights instead of their original bezel ring.",590,universalist

Printing tips:
Print with the screw thread facing upwards. 1mm shell and 23% fill are usually enough. Layer heights up to 0.3mm are possible, recommended value: 0.2mm. Printed successfully on an Ultimaker with PLA.
Regarding M42:
There are two versions for M42: One for older lenses (mostly before 1985) which exhibit larger undercuts with ~1.5mm height, and one for more recent lenses with smaller undercuts (~1.2mm).",590,universalist

0,286,Shogi iconified,"Shogi is one of the oldest variants of the game that we know as chess. It boasts some very cool mechanics like adding captured opponents to your army and piece promotion by flipping the pieces. However, traditional Shogi sets can scare away potential new players since you need to learn the Japanese characters for the pieces along with their moves.
This set solves both problems at once. Each piece has the name and an icon representing their moves. A blunt line from the sphere means that piece can move or capture one square in that direction. A pointed line from the sphere means that piece can move in as many unobstructed spaces as are available in that direction. The knight moves similar to it's counterpart in western Chess, except that it can only jump to the two spaces in front of it, and to one to the left and right, not the spaces sideways or backwards. Then when you get to the 7th rank flip the piece over to promote it and it's new movement is shown.

For greatest effect change filament colors at regular intervals. Change the deluxe board every 6mm, change the card board every 2mm. Start with light green or yellow for the Plains of Kashe, then gray for the Silver City, then dark green for the Forests of Coindor, then tan or brown for the Copper Peaks and finally white for the peaks of the mountains.

Each coin has unique elements to distinguish it. The coins are sized similarly sized to pocket change, ranging in size from quarter to dime, and are slightly thicker than traiditional coins (3mm thick) to make them easier to handle as tokens. Of course scaling is always an option (though the surface details may suffer if made too thin). One side has traditional numerals on it, the other side has roman numerals, but pausing the print and changing filament at the 50% mark to a different color is a way to make the sides even more distinctive.",669,joealarson

The headsman moves and captures in the same manner as a king though counts as a pawn for all intents and purposes. When a player makes a capture with their headsman, the captured piece's head may be swapped onto any piece adjacent to the headsman (after the capture move has been made) transforming the adjacent piece (friend or foe) into the type that was captured. The headsman may itself be captured and have its head transferred in this manner as well.

We may have met the goal, but anything over that just means we get to make more books, and not much would make the gang at IGG happier.
Also, if you're into bizarre, stream of consciousness nerdery, we just launched our Lost Agency Archives podcast, wherein we at Ill Gotten Games record our gaming sessions.

NAME: Jools Calixa SPECIES: Human (Clone) ORIGIN: Zyntradi Commonwealth
Heiress to the Calixa fortune, Jools was gifted with the brane ship, Castellan, on her 18th name day. Along with her android companion, Solver, and a minimal crew employed to her house, Jools forged off into the Multiverse. Since then, Jools and Solver have seen and experienced things that most beings only dream of. Using Nexus City as her home point, Jools often returns to refuel and resupply before heading back out to parts unknown.

The Awadi (Kaldro's species) are an intelligent, though extremely slow species that evolved peacefully on the paradise-world of Khapia 7. They were created using the Wayfarer random alien tables (the unedited beta can be found here: https://pinshape.com/items/362-3d-printed-wayfarer... ) and Kaldro himself was a random creation (as are many of the characters for our Lost Agency games).

NAME: Yarp SPECIES: Iolosian Mantle Crab ORIGIN: Mooncliffs of Iolos
Arguably a non-sapient species, Iolosian Mantle Crabs such as Yarp are often employed as pack mules by adventurers forging into inhospitable territories. Left alone, Mantle Crabs are content living peacefully in the cliff-side tunnels they call home. However, once trained, Mantle Crabs often bond to their owners, even protecting them against perceived threats.

0,379,Odinn's Dice,"Description
From the fantastic Heroine's Quest: The Herald of Ragnarok, an RPG/adventure game hybrid from Crystal Shard.
http://www.crystalshard.net/hq.htm
http://www.crystalshard.net/index.php
This is one of the best AGS (Adventure Games Studio) games I've ever played, and their attention to Norse myth really won me over. If you played the old Sierra Hero's Quest games, I guarantee you'll love this. The game is 100% free, and a real labor of love for those who made it. You can get it on their site and on Steam, and if you liked it as much as I did, support them with a donation on PayPal.
This simple dice game is featured within Heroine's Quest and I pretty much immediately decided that I needed a physical version. There's no better way to weather the Fimbulwinter than to hole up with some mead and roll some dice for 3D printed gold. The rules are pretty simple, so here goes:
----THE RULES----
As near as I can tell, the game can support upwards of two players. Each player has 3 dice and a stack of coins (print a bunch if you're feeling wealthy). To start the game, all players place their arms on the table (in a manly, viking fashion) and roll the dice so they are obscured from the other players. Starting with the first player (decide who that is somehow... probably via feats of strength or pain resistance) each player takes a turn.
During a turn, you may bet a coin (placing it into a pile in the center of the table), bet two coins and and re-roll any selection of dice, or put two coins in and call (forcing all others to do so at that moment). Once you have chosen to call, the dice are revealed and the winner is decided.
----Scoring-----
The following combinations of rolls are ranked from best to worst. In the case of a tie, roll off with all of your dice until one viking...er, I mean player has won:
3 Ravens (Odinn)
3 Hammers (Thor)
3 Runes (Asgard)
1 of each (Midgard)
From there, Ravens are worth more than Hammers, which are worth more than Runes, which are worth more than Blanks. You get the picture. The winner takes the pot and is congratulated for being the brawniest or something, and, should coins remain, the game continues.
The base dice are 20mm (which is huge, chunky, and good for jotun and/or trolls) though I've included 16mm and 12mm versions which should be better for our puny human hands.
Enjoy!

We'll be updating the progress of the game and provide expanded rules on our blog, so be sure and check us out there as well
http://illgottengames.blogspot.com/
All of the pieces were designed using Tinkercad.
https://tinkercad.com/users/bHIdLANxoGl-arian-crof...
Instructions
Each piece was printed on my Makerbot Replicator at a .10 layer height with 10% infill. I printed them all one piece at a time, though you can feel free to try and print bricks of them. I had trouble doing so and it was probably due to my calibration. All in all, the set takes about 9 hours to print, give or take.
Rules
So, for the core set as I've designed it, you'll need the following (and I've included the colors you should paint things, though this is only a suggestion):
-3 Conscripts (tan)
-2 Archers (tan)
-2 Spearmen (tan)
-2 Swordsmen (tan)
-1 Shieldmaiden (tan)
-1 Fire Mage (tan)
-3 Beastfolk Stalkers (dark green)
-2 Beastfolk Marauders (dark green)
-2 Beastfolk Juggernauts (dark green)
-2 Forest Witches (dark green)
-1 Cursed Ranger (dark green)
-1 Druid (dark green)
-1 Caer (tan)
-1 Druid's Circle (dark green)
-2 Village Tiles (tan)
-3 Water Tiles (blue)
-4 Hills Tiles (light green)
-4 Field Tiles (yellow)
-7 Forest Tiles (dark green)
You'll also need a grip of six-sided dice (6 for each player) and it helps immensely if half of them are a different color. The rules are in super-beta mode (just finished writing them last night) so expect typos and confusion, but throw me some feedback and I can answer questions/clean up the document as we go.

Born to powerful wizard ruling over the Godborn Isles, Iolanda was schooled in the ways of magic from an early age. Possessed of an inquisitive mind, Iolanda spent much of her youth delving deeply into forbidden magics found in the ruins scattered throughout the islands of her father’s realm. After finding an ancient and powerful spell capable of tearing a hole in the fabric of space, Iolanda, heedless of the warnings of her peers, entered the mysterious rift. After a harrowing journey through the Multiverse, Iolanda found herself in Nexus City where she was taken in by the Academy of Arcane Studies. Within several years, Iolanda became one of the highest ranking Blue Mages within the institution. Her mastery of summoning and mixing of spells and natural chemistry has earned her high honors with the Arch Magi and, there are rumors that she is being groomed to enter their ranks when a seat becomes vacant.

-3 Shambling Corpses (purple) -2 Shrouded Vassals (purple) -2 Dread Riders (purple) -2 Barrow Guards (purple) -1 Barrow Lord (purple) -1 Necromancer (purple)
-1 Temple of Light (White) -1 Fallen Caer (Purple) -5 Village Tiles (tan) -4 Water Tiles (blue) -7 Hill Tiles (light green) -4 Ruin Tiles (Purple)
You'll also need a grip of six-sided dice (6 for each player) and it helps immensely if half of them are a different color. The rules are in super-beta mode (just finished writing them last night) so expect typos and confusion, but throw me some feedback and I can answer questions/clean up the document as we go. I'd definitely expect some of these abilities to change, but hey, who knows? ;-)",1031,Dutchmogul

NAME: Solver (Unit H-42B) SPECIES: Model-7 Android ORIGIN: Innovation (Circle-Tech HQ)
One of a secretly produced run of sapient robots built from schematics stolen from the late Dr. Harlan Smythe, Unit H42-B was gifted to Jules Calixa, heiress to the Calixa fortune and major Circle-Tech shareholder. Though designed as a companion unit, Jules found many uses for the android, nicknaming him “Solver” as his penchant for rapid-learning resulted in the acquisition of many useful skills, including the operation and repair of Jules’ Brane-Ship, the Castellan. As his mistress’ affections for him grew stronger, so to did Solver’s bond and desire to protect her. Against Circle-Tech’s advice, Jules had many of Solver’s control sub-systems removed, leaving only the protocol that binds him to her service, adding a caveat that the program will deactivate in the event of her death, leaving Solver free to walk his own path.

Introducing Pocket-Tactics! 
A fast-paced, modular strategy board game that all fits in a tiny bag. Still not sure what we'll do with this little game, though I'd like to make it free to print and play to my fellow makers. My nerdsmen and I have been having a blast with it these last few days. If anyone ends up printing one of these let me know how it plays, I'd love to get some feedback. Reporting any typos/mistakes in the rules would be greatly appreciated as well. We'll be updating the progress of the game and provide expanded rules on our blog, so be sure and check us out there as well http://illgottengames.blogspot.com/ All of the pieces were designed using Tinkercad. http://illgottengames.blogspot.com/
Instructions 
Each piece was printed on my Makerbot Replicator at a .10 layer height with 10% infill. I printed them all one piece at a time, though you can feel free to try and print bricks of them. I had trouble doing so and it was probably due to my calibration. All in all, the set takes about 9 hours to print, give or take. So, for the core set as I've designed it, you'll need the following (and I've included the colors you should paint things, though this is only a suggestion): -3 Conscripts (tan) -2 Archers (tan) -2 Spearmen (tan) -2 Swordsmen (tan) -1 Shieldmaiden (tan) -1 Fire Mage (tan) -3 Beastfolk Stalkers (dark green) -2 Beastfolk Marauders (dark green) -2 Beastfolk Juggernauts (dark green) -2 Forest Witches (dark green) -1 Cursed Ranger (dark green) -1 Druid (dark green) -1 Caer (tan) -1 Druid's Circle (dark green) -2 Village Tiles (tan) -3 Water Tiles (blue) -4 Hills Tiles (light green) -4 Field Tiles (yellow) -7 Forest Tiles (dark green) You'll also need a grip of six-sided dice (6 for each player) and it helps immensely if half of them are a different color. The rules are in super-beta mode (just finished writing them last night) so expect typos and confusion, but throw me some feedback and I can answer questions/clean up the document as we go. -Big props to our tech editor, John Peden (john@johnruddpeden.com) for this new, squeaky clean rules sheet",1031,Dutchmogul

0,493,PranceVichard Human Syndicate Enforcer,"NAME: Prance Vichard SPECIES: Human ORIGIN: Zyntradi Commonwealth 
Once an all-star Entropy Player on a proudly all-human team, Prance stubbornly refused to take a fall during an important match. In retaliation, Zero Syndicate goons ambushed him while he was celebrating and cut off his leg with mono-filament wire. Refusing to get back into the game and offer his opponents handicap points due to his cybernetics, Prance retired. After several years wallowing in anger, Prance found his pension running thin. Out of options, he hired himself as muscle to a local bookie. After his employer was murdered by Zero Syndicate goons, Prance was given the choice of either working for the syndicate or to join his employer in the Undercity maintenance chasms. Choosing the former, Prance now works for the very agency that took his dreams of being a legendary athlete. Biding his time, Prance does their bidding while he plots for revenge.

0,517,George R. R. Martin's Cyvasse (unofficial game),"This is my attempt to translate the chess-like game featured in George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire novels (Game of Thrones). Being a huge fan of the man and his work, I wanted to try and give his game the best translation I could. Working with my good friend (and studious Martin scholar) Nate Stephens, I adapted the game to include everything mentioned in the book into a rules set I found believable for a game made during the emulated time period, while also keeping the games in mind that Martin has mentioned as inspiration during interviews. So, Let me know if you get to printing/playing it, and if you have any suggestions for rules adjustments, variants, etc, post in the comments below and let's get a dialogue going. The rules PDF is with the other downloads, and its a light read (2 pages). Game on! 
Instructions 
With the current rules configurations, you'll need to print the following: Each side (Onyx and Alabaster) has Rabble x3, Spearmen x3, Crossbowmen x3, Light Horses x3, Heavy Horses x2, Elephants x2, Catapult x1, Trebuchet x1, Dragon x1, King x1, Keep x1 All of the pieces are grouped to reflect the distribution, so you only need to print each STL once. Of course, if you'e feeling brave, you can print the full plate, That has all the pieces one side will need. In addition, you'll need 6 mountains (three per player), four board sections (two per player), a pair of screen braces (both are in the same STL) and the two halves of the screen. I printed mine in black ABS and painted the pieces with acrylic model paints though the pieces would be great printed in black and white ABS, and wouldn't really require painting (that's just how I roll). I also painted the board in a checker-pattern. It wasn't necessary, but it makes movements (especially diagonal ones) a little easier to track.",1031,Dutchmogul
0,518,Forest Dragon,"As famine struck the dark forests of Jotunheim, Wolf-Eater scaled the impossible cliffs of Ymir's Brow, descending into the lowlands of Midgard and sating his hunger on the tribes of men. I wanted to make a proper Norse dragon. I really liked the idea of an antlered forest wyrm with vestigial wings adapted to climbing giant trees. Currently using this guy as the center of an RPG storyline. He's scaled to 15mm (making him rather massive) so he can be used with my Pocket-Tactics models, but he'd make a good dragon for heroic scale (25-30mm gaming) as well.

He spends most of his time ""owning newbs"" on his computer. DJ Fish is quite the opposite, he tends to be the life of the party pumping his original tracks at every chance he can get. Sir fish is the sophisticated one of the bunch (or so he thinks), he grew up in the same pond as the others, but seems to have acquired an accent of a far off place he has never visited. Baby fish is the child that never grew up, though the same age as the others tends to be quiet, reserved and needs to be babied by the other fish. LeFishy is relatively normal compared to his counterparts, therefore is the unwritten leader of the group.",1297,LeHof

0,713,TARDIS Run board game Print-In-One,"Updated 12/17/2015
Many of the Doctor's most feared opponents have teleported into the TARDIS to steal the last copy of the Black Scroll of Rassilon from the TARDIS library. With no one else who can help the Doctor's past regenerations have been gathered to protect the scroll. Whoever finds the Black Scroll and escapes first wins! TARDIS run is a game of luck and risk management inspired by Backgammon, Parchisi, and the Ancient Egyptian game Senet.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqKEkfNf1fI
The board for this game is designed to fold into a neat carrying case that holds everything necessary to play inside. The board prints in one piece and pops off the build platform ready to fold and play, but a large build area is necessary. If a smaller build area is desired use the print-in-parts version of the game.
Rules are included in image and PDF form. Print the image at 300DPI or use the PDF, cut the rules out and fold in 4ths to fit in the board, assuming the scale was unchanged.
I find it is best to print the board with the charm so the light on top prints well. Plus you get a little charm when you're done. You can also choose to use any of the doctor or monster pawns you want from here:

Directions: The top should be printed as hollow as possible with no infill. You may need to print at a much, much slower print to avoid warping issues. The bottom should be printed at the highest density possible. The closer to 100% the better. The goal is to have the highest possible weight difference between the top and bottom pieces. If possible, sand or smooth the bottom piece to achieve the best wobble.

0,947,Troke classic board game and 3d printed board,"This re-imagining of the 1956 game, Troke, changes the simple cylinders of the original into detailed models and adds a 3D printed board with spaces for the pieces. A classic, out-of-print game is back! 3D printing is once again thumbing it's nose at scarcity.
From BGG http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1993/troke
""The sub-title for Troke is 'Castle Checkers'.
""Abstract strategy game where players move three different kinds of pieces (tower, wall, and moat) across a board diagonally forward, straight ahead or sideways, but never backwards. .... [I]t is a race to see who can get all their pieces to [the opposite] goal line. A feature of the game is that if you merge with one or two different pieces you take one or two extra moves. You are allowed to merge (capture) with opponent’s pieces and thus move them away from their goal and towards your own. Making moves becomes complicated as the game progresses because capturing pieces requires that additional moves be made. If these extra moves can not be made, then the original capture move can not be made.""
Best printed on a home 3D printer. Print the pieces and board home parts 4 times in different colors and the board center in a neutral color. For extra dramatic effect the filament can be changed at 0.75mm so the paths are more dramatic.

...Well, not hundreds, because there's only 3 cars and 2 different wheel types, so that's 12 different mixes, unless you decide to go crazy putting front and backs together in which case we might be able to get up to 30. We could potentially say there's 480 possibilities if you want to go binary with the wheels.
But that's not the point.
If this set does well I can add future expansions like other cars or a 6-axis option with trains and semi-trucks.

0,963,Walkabot - Gravity Powered Ramp Walking Robot - Parts Plated,"This version is the same as the first Walkabot but the parts have been plated into a single STL file to lower the printing cost if you are going to use the print service.

If you are going to print a Walkabot at home then you will probably find it easier to print with the individual files found here: https://pinshape.com/items/781-3d-printed-walkabot...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Walkabot is a gravity powered ramp walking robot. Place him on a shallow ramp, tilt him to one side, let go and he will walk down the slope. The robot makes a ""walka-walka"" sound as he walks.
See the video of him walking here: http://youtu.be/vgM6PPkw6cQ Assemble the robot by positioning the legs inside the body and pushing the axle through the body and legs as shown in the assembly diagram. The legs should swing freely inside the body. Attach the arms to the outside of the body on the axle. The arms can be moved up and down to adjust the balance slightly. ",1774,Karl_Williams
0,964,Recovering Supero Hero!,"Looking to be more than just a toy, Esmerald is a wearable game-set that turns the child into a superhero. Designed purposely for children in hospitals, it tells a story: The child is normally a superhero but the arch enemy has stolen all his hero items and its power, sending him or her to the hospital, ill. In order to recover its power and be back in the streets bringing law and order, the child must overcome challenges set by his/her family and doctors, that may include completing certain physical rehabilitation sessions such as chemo, finishing the medicine jar, having the cast removed... or having that dreadful shot taken. After every challenge succeded, the child recovers one of his items. Slowly, his/her powers return fully with every item. 
This makes the stay in the hospital more bearable, fun and challenging, as every new day is an opportunity to recover more power. Of course, this requires the full participation of the family and medical staff, to make the child feel like the superhero he is. 
• Background and research include Child and Teenager Psychology, Pedagogy, and simply having fun while designing it. It was my goal to offer not a plastic figure to the child, but an adventure that turns his stay in bed into something he or she is eager and feels good about accomplishing with the help of everyone. It involves the system around the child to behave differently together for a good cause. Imagine if the whole children's hospital ""played"" this game! It would be a super hero hospital! Every child sharing their progress and asking what the other's powers are!
• Every child can ""design"" their own power items and invent their superhero story, and the toy can be customized. Esmerald is just an example. The items must allow the child to wear them while still in the hospital, attending challenges wearing them, they are his/her powers! (of course maybe shower time is ok not to wear).
• Esmerald power items are printed flat in PLA for faster printing times and then bent while still hot using a pencil or soda can as mold.
Either boys or girls, using Esmerald or creating their own, at a hospital or at home, it doesn't matter.... crime never rests! I hope this idea reaches real children and helps them recover faster and happier!",1502,Danny Sanchez

0,1973,Universal 3D Printer Filament Filter,"This small accessory can protect your FFF 3D printer filament from two common issues - cleaning and lubrication.
A sponge wipes the filament clean from any dust particles and prevents them clogging the extruder. By dropping a few drops of common mineral oil on the sponge the filament passing through gets lubricated thus relieving the extruder motor from strain. Lubrication is specially useful if the filament needs to travel through long tubes before it enters the extruder. INSTRUCTIONS 3D-print the provided STL file and insert a small piece sponge into the filament filter. Poke a hole into the sponge and make sure the filament passes through and comes out at the other end. Soak the sponge with a few drops of mineral oil (as for sewing machines, door hinges or bicycle chains). Place the filament filter somewhere in between the spool and the extruder. If you have a plastic tube which guides the filament to extruder (such as a bowden solution) make sure you place the filter before the filament enters the tube.

-------------------------------------
The piece is a tribute to one of my favorite pieces of technology in human history, the Space Shuttle. I was disappointed with the retirement of NASA’s shuttle program, but hopefully greater things will take its place.
It's imperative that human beings constantly remind themselves of our place in space. We need more drive to push the boundaries of our space exploration to ensure our survival.
I created the design after reading Chris Hadfield's book An Astronauts Guide to Life on Earth. I loved reading about his first launch. Walking out to the launch pad for flight in 1995 on the shuttle Atlantis. The surreal idea that he would join one of just a handful of humans to leave the planet.",4110,schuylerwhite

It's designed for a nozzle width of 0.45
Of course if you get a print from the machines here it will come out beautifully first time and you could even do one in each color to have a set of decorative flexing coasters for your tea and scones when the Queen visits.

0,2472,Iconified Shogi,"Shogi is one of the oldest variants of the game that we know as chess. It boasts some very cool mechanics like adding captured opponents to your army and piece promotion by flipping the pieces. However, traditional Shogi sets can scare away potential new players since you need to learn the Japanese characters for the pieces along with their moves.
This set solves both problems at once. Each piece has the name and an icon representing their moves. A blunt line from the sphere means that piece can move or capture one square in that direction. A pointed line from the sphere means that piece can move in as many unobstructed spaces as are available in that direction. The knight moves similar to it's counterpart in western Chess, except that it can only jump to the two spaces in front of it, and to one to the left and right, not the spaces sideways or backwards. Then when you get to the 7th rank flip the piece over to promote it and it's new movement is shown.
This set comes with a modular snap-together board for play on.
Setup and rules can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi",669,joealarson

0,2668,Telescopic Light Saber,"On Friday, November 20th, we were part of the 30 million people to keep their breath while watching the trailer for the next Star Wars movie. As designers, we were surprised to discover a new configuration of the lightsaber revealed in the now epic (and polemic) scene showing an unknown Sith Lord walking in a snowy forest.
As Makers, we couldn’t help but try to find out by ourselves if this “crossguard” design was a good configuration or not... So we decided to build one, with our army of 3D printers.
Of course, the ""darkness"" of the movie sequence and the lack of details on the weapon itself left a lot of place for imagination and interpretation.
A dozen of 3D printable lightsabers being already available for download on internet, we decided to make one that would be completely customizable. The modular system we invented makes hundreds of configurations possible. From Yoda’s lightsaber to Darth Maul’s.
Here's complete video of the crossguard saber's assembly, and in action :https://vimeo.com/113298946",1194,le FabShop

0,2709,Shuttle Launch (S+),"Other Sizes: XL, L, M, S+, S, T, Keychain
Can print in full color as shown
Smoke is flattened on the bottom, serving as a stand for the piece to stay up.
-------------------------------------
The piece is a tribute to one of my favorite pieces of technology in human history, the Space Shuttle. I was disappointed with the retirement of NASA’s shuttle program, but hopefully greater things will take its place.
It's imperative that human beings constantly remind themselves of our place in space. We need more drive to push the boundaries of our space exploration to ensure our survival.
I created the design after reading Chris Hadfield's book An Astronauts Guide to Life on Earth. I loved reading about his first launch. Walking out to the launch pad for flight in 1995 on the shuttle Atlantis. The surreal idea that he would join one of just a handful of humans to leave the planet.",4110,schuylerwhite
0,2713,Celestia Ball jointed pony base Custom blank SMALL size,"25% SMALLER! Celestia Alicorn Base
This small pony is fully articulate with ball joints to create a variety of poses and movement to your doll. Ponies have 15 points of articulation, including the hooves! Comes in pieces, item must be strong with elastic cord. we recommend clear beading cord of .7mm. There is a video to describe how to do so, It is recommended that you have minor crafting experience to be able to string the doll together successfully. Easy to paint and customize into your own character. Acrylics work great to paint your pony with and you can dye the pony with dyes similar to RIT dye or choose from a few dyed color options available here at pinshape/sculpteo. If you want to root hair you can use a dremel to drill in holes to root the hair in small plugs using a needle and thread technique. Item is meant for older collectors and not suitable for very young children. Small parts represent choking hazard. We recommend ages 8 and up and items for display and gentle play.

0,2719,Vega - The LED-lit Christmas Star,"With Creative Tools 3D-printable Vega Xmas Star we want to honor the winners of The Nobel Prize in Physics 2014.
Without the hard and tenacious work of Isamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano and Shuji Nakamura, today we wouldn't have efficient LED lights or HD flatscreen television sets, computers and mobile devices. The 3D-files for Creative Tools 3D-printable Vega Xmas Star are therefore designed to enclose a standard and commonly available LED light strip.

FEATURES 
Modular five-pointed star made of 5 identical parts 
Short segments of 1.75 mm filament hold the parts together (no glue required!) 
Ventilation holes provide cooling airflow 
Wall-mount included for horizontal or vertical attachment Wall-mount allows cable rotation adjustment to easily align star parallel to wall or window. 
Adapted for LED strips 8 x 3 x 1000 mm (12 V, 0.5 A). 
DISCLAIMER 
We have successfully used this star with standard low-power LED strips for indoor use. Please refer to the your LED light source manual and follow all safety instructions. 
PRINT SETTINGS
We recommend 3D-print operators to use transparent PLA plastic filament. Two (2) shells/perimeters are sufficient for strength. For faster prints “rough” resolution at 0.3 or 0.4 can be used and there is no need for infill. You can print at zero (0) percent infill. Turn off support structures. The top section of the star segments are closed automatically via “bridging”. These settings are for filament-based FFF-3D-printers only. 
MATERIAL CONSUMPTION Roughly 70 grams of filament in total. Since the design does not need support structures, no material is wasted. 
MAKE IT IN COLOUR! You can 3D-print in different plastic filament colours. The modular tips of the star also allow for variations in colour per tip. Colour variations can also be achieved by using LED light strips with an RGB colour control.

0,2722,iPhone 6 / iPhone 6+ Macro Close-Up Lens Holder,"Macro lens adapter for the iPhone 6 and 6+ 
This design fits the iPhone 6 and 6+ as well as the iPad Mini. I designed the original version of this for my iPhone 4 when I couldn't find the close-up image quality I wanted. I found a source for a high quality $5 surplus lens that fits into this for excellent macro images. Check out the example photos. 
PLEASE NOTE: This model will not slide over iPhone 6 and 6+ cases. It fits only on an uncovered iPhone. I am working on one for cases. Print this model and then buy a glass lens for $4.50 from Surplus Shed: http://www.surplusshed.com/. Their part number is L4581. For some reason the search function on the Surplus Shed site won't search part numbers. To find L4581, use the ""Lens Finder"" on their home page. In ""Lens Finder"" type:
Lens Type: PCX, Plano Convex
Diameter: 12mm to 12mm
Focal length: 39mm to 39mm
That will get you to L4581.
The lens fits in a recess in the model and is held in place with a drop of Superglue. If you get any glue on the lens, it can be cleaned off with nail polish remover or acetone.
EASY ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS !
The lens is plano-convex (one side is flat). When inserted in the model, the flat side of the lens should face the phone. Press the lens into the opening before applying any glue. Make sure it is seated all the way against the support ring at the bottom of the hole. Again, do this first WITHOUT glue. Once you are sure the lens is properly seated, from the front, squeeze a TINY drop of superglue, at two or three spots around the edge of the lens, into the seam between the lens and the plastic holder.  Each drop will wick around the edge the lens by itself so you won't need to spread it around. Let the assembly sit for 5 minutes before doing any lens cleaning.",8262,lens42

0,2779,3D Printed Bow Tie and Button Cover,"3D Printed Bow Tie and Button Cover. (Support Free)
Software used: 3D Studio Max, Netfabb, Rhinoceros 5. - 
 - 3D Printed Bow Tie: letter ""V"" stands for Victory that shows creativity, confidence and success. This unique Bow tie  replaces the traditional ones from various functional shapes to different materials. The making process is a combine of the use of 3D printers such as PLA, ABS with desktop printer like Makerbot, Ultimaker. Clients can even print them out by using industrial printer (SLS) to complete a perfect finished product.
I have used 3D printer Makerbot Replicator 2 to print out this product. It was printed out separate in 3 different parts, then joint them together. Setting up: Makerbot Replicator 2 Materials: PLA (Spraying with Gold Colour) Infill: 30%
Layer height: 0.15mm; Temperature and Speed: Default.  The products are printed with Raft and ""no support"". Printing time frame is approximately 1 hour. If using desktop printer (FDM) such as Makerbot or Ultimaker, highly recommend that should print each part of products separately to have a nice finishing touch. If products are made all in one file, it is still printable but the travel move might not bring a nice result. 
 - 3D Printed Button Cover: the idea of this product comes from 'something for everyday wear that is functional, fashionable and practical'. This is a 'must-have' items because most shirt nowadays are button shirt, even in the cuff link part. The 3D printed button cover is at first made for 'replacing cuff link' purposes. But because of the art design and flexible function, designer start using it as button covers, give the shirt an ultimate refreshing fashionable look. It is easy to wear by sliding it into your button wherever people want on their shirts- an extraordinary creative and luxurious feel. 
I show on here two Button Cover design which are ""EPIC"" and ""AWESOME"", and wear it on the arm buttons of my shirts. They look stunning and amazing. Same with 3D Printed Bow Tie, this product can also print out in numerous different materials and 3D printers. You can choose to print out in desktop printer (FDM) or industrial printer as SLS.
In this product, I have used Makerbot Replicator 2 to print out.
Setting up: Makerbot Replicator 2
The Face is lay down on the bed
Materials: PLA (Spraying with Gold Colour)
Infill: 80%
Speed while Travelling: 30mm/s
Speed while Extruding: 30mm/s
Printing in 12 minutes. It also works with many different size of buttons. You just need to scale the model before printing out to fit with the buttons of your shirts, jackets. This file was design to fit with the normal shirt of men's wear.",8376,HotVitLon

0,2826,Open Toys,"The Open Toy project is the result of a 2013 workshop at Domaine de Boisbuchet. Samuel N. Bernier had decided to use material waste from the band saw, such as cork and wood, to create toys by 3D printing small accessories with a MakerBot he had brought on site. He designed six accessories that would transform the found objects into planes, helicopters, birds and so on.
It’s was a week after the project had been presented, while looking at the Domaine’s garden, that Bernier had the idea to replace the wood and cork from his project by comestible material such as vegetables and fruits. The vegetables also had the advantage of being easier to pierce without tools than wood.
The project was left behind during almost ten months when Thomas Thibault, intern in Bernier’s design team at le FabShop's creation studio, started creating new parts for the collection. The rocket and submarine parts are from him.
The Open Toys were presented for the first time in October 2014 during a workshop at the Autodesk Pop-Up gallery, in Paris. The kids present at the event transformed with great interest potatoes, carrots, eggplants and cucumbers into cars, sea vehicles and space ships. The Mister Potato from de digital fabrication age had just been invented.
It’s to celebrate the release of their exercise book « Impression 3D Pas à Pas » that le FabShop decided to publish for free download the Open Toys files on all principal 3D printing platform : Thingiverse, YouMagine, Cults 3D and Instructables. Hoping that the users of these communities will contribute to the Open Toys collection big creating new models. Le FabShop’s designers are engaging themselves to do the same in the next months.

With Buckle Bro, the possibilities are literally endless. Change your belt buckle on the fly to suit whatever mood you’re feeling, have fun with a traditional look or go crazy and sport a light show on your belt!
The Belt Buckle’s form is purposely simple not to distract away from the content that is being displayed on the screen, it acts as a cradle for any Samsung Galaxy S series smart phone. With an image of your favorite belt buckle chosen and displayed on the screen, the phone is then slipped into the side of the buckle and held by friction. When the phone is in the buckle, its sole purpose is to display whatever you want it to, the Belt Bro is not meant to be another phone holster, buttons are not accessible. It is simply, a HIGH TECH BELT BUCKLE.

0,3137,Impossible 3D-printed bolt and nut,"The ""Impossible bolt and nut"" is an amusing 3D-printable two-part assembly with a working thread, where a nut is trapped on a bolt.
The single STL file contains the nut placed at a slight distance from the bolt's head. The gap between both is sized to create a ""skipped"" layer thus making a fracture plane so that the nut can be removed from bolt's head. We have supplied several STL files scaled to commonly available 3D-print heights. Please choose the one that closest fits your desired print height. It is possible to scale the STL up or down with successful results. Please see instructions for more information on how to 3D-print this bolt and nut. Also note that some slicing software and settings could interpret the air gap as an STL defect and remove the gap during print. You will have to disable the STL heal function. Download the STL files and 3D-print your own! :) VIDEO http://youtu.be/GbDMlNjrUM4 The gap There is a gap between the nut and the bolt's head. The size is adjusted so that the slicing software will ""skip"" a layer. This air gap should be small enough for the nut's first layer to adhere to the bolt's head, but still large enough for them to separate easily. We adjusted this gap so that it fits 3D-prints of PLA and ABS. REMOVING THE NUT FROM THE BOLT Make sure you don't cut yourself! Use a thin knife blad and insert it between the bolt's head and the nut. Wiggle it and move it around the bolt until you can feel than the majority of the gap is broken free. Remove the knife and carefully unscrew the nut. CHOOSE THE CORRECT STL FILE We provided several STL files in this thing to fit different 3D printer Z-heights. Choose the STL which fits your 3D printer and scale it slightly if needed. The important thing is not to affect the gap too much when scaling the bolt.",839,CreativeTools

0,3144,Deathly Hallows Pendant,"An artistic rendering of the deathly hallows symbol with the actual deathly hallows.
In this 1.5"" tall pendant I combine the items of the Deathly Hallows; the Elder Wand, Resulrection Stone and Invisibility Cloak, into the form of the symbol that describes them. This object is 3D printed to order in your choice of colors.
This unique design by award winning 3D designer Joe Larson is one of a kind takes the imagery of the Deathly Hallows one step further than ever before.
""'The Elder Wand,' he said, and he drew a straight vertical line on the parchment. 'The Resurrection Stone,' he said, and he added a circle on top of the line. 'The Cloak of Invisibility,' he finished, enclosing both line and circle in a triangle, to make the symbol that so intrigued Hermione. 'Together,' he said, 'the Deathly Hallows.'"" -Xenophilius Lovegood

0,3145,Gabriel Schama inspired art piece,"I was inspired by a kickstarter for woodcut art (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1154796888/wood-lasers-art ) by artist Gabriel Schama where he made coordinated patterns in 1/8 wood that were then layered to great effect. The process looked a little to me like the layers of a 3D print, so I decided to see if 3D printing could recreated the effect. I started with modeling the shape, only instead of intentional layers I made gradual slopes that the slicer would create layers. Then I cut it thick (low resolution settings) to see how the effect came out.
In my prints it seems even at high resolution the layers aren't noticable to be used for artistic purposes, which is ironic because they layers have always been too high to be considered smooth. It still makes a nice hanging and is something pretty to look at.

The rhino is a creature of substance, stamina and explosive power. His intimate connection with the earth that makes it a symbol for confidence and steadiness.

0,3160,35mm Film to 120 Spool Adapter,"Do you have a 120 film camera? Want to shoot images with the sprocket holes exposed? Want to shoot specialty films that are not available in 120 format? If so, or you just like to play with film, these adapters are for you. These were designed for the Flyer 6x6 camera developed as a result of the Pinhole Printed Kickstarter project (pinholeprinted.com) but can be used in any 120 medium format camera.
Proven design in use by photographers, this adapter centers 35mm film onto a 120 format spool. There are two parts for the top and bottom of the 35mm film canister. This adapter is perfectly matched to the 120 spool for 35mm, which is at pinshape.com/items/3162-3d-printed-120-takeup-spool-for-35mm-film.
I prefer the Shapeways version for accuracy and durability, but if you download and print your own on a filament printer, you will need to use 50%+ infill, and you may need to do some trimming.
Do not force adapters on. Make sure the splines are aligned and if tight, trim/sand or wiggle on carefully. The splines may need to be trimmed to fit Kalt bulk loading canisters and some others.
The hole for viewing the film number (usually a red window) on the camera must be taped over with black gaffer's tape or some suitable opaque tape to avoid back side exposure of the film. You will need to wind blindly about 1-1/2 turns at the beginning and taper down to 1-1/4 turn at the end. Most medium format cameras have no rewind, so you will need to unload the film in a darkroom or changing bag and manually rewind the 35mm film back into its canister. When processing, specify ""process only"" and ""do not cut"" and cut the film yourself.
If you do not have a 3D printer or have it tied up with other things, check at http://www.pinholeprinted.com/order/35mm-film-to-120-spool-adapter/ for alternatives.

0,3165,Stacking box,"Think inside the box, you can never have to many boxes.
Print a few of your own stacking boxes to keep your things in order may they be screws, nuts, bolts, toys or other miscellaneous things.
Just like our Candy Bowl we designed this box specifically for testing 3D-prints with large-bore nozzles. The result is a semi-transparent box 3D-printed at 0.8mm layerheight with a 1.0 mm nozzle.
Even though it is possible to print this box at higher speeds, we kept it down to achieve a high-gloss shiny surface toghether with a all together higher quality print. This shows very well in the two attached pictures with the lower part being printed at a higher speed than the top part. Not only will the result have a higher degree of transparency but the print quality will also be alot better since the plastic can be extruded and cooled down at a lower rate which is needed when extruded with a larger size nozzle.
The outer dimensions of the box is 120x120x80mm. At around 20-30 mm/s it took less than two hours to print.
We have kept the geomtry as simple as possible to make it easy to print. To get rid of the layer-change zipper-line we used vase-mode in our print settings.
To make the box strong and achieve optimal transparency we 3D-printed the candy bowl using taulman 3D t-glase (PETT) filament.

The first file is the entire model; the following five files are the model broken up into sections of its parts.  I printed this model all in one file on standard resolution, using a support structure and on a raft. That being said, the hull really does needs support and the gun & axles will benefit from a raft and/or grid. I found it really difficult to remove the support structure around the wheels and it was not needed. I also have included the model split into sections as to reduce print area and to allow for custom settings on the individual files. The parts fit tightly, so filing and sanding will probably be necessary to allow all appropriate parts to move freely.

0,3213,East Van Cross,My 3D interpretation of Ken Lum's iconic East Van Cross,3379,John Biehler
0,3214,Tablet Car Mount,I wanted a mount for my Nexus 7 tablet in my Kia Soul that could easily be stowed if I wasn't using the tablet and for security. I used part of a cheap tablet case for easy removal of the tablet and hot glued this 3D printed part that goes into the CD slot to the back of the case shell. This should be compatible with any 'mini' sized tablet case...not sure how a bigger device would fair from a weight standpoint. You could likely also print any case that is a similar clip-in style and glue this part to it as well. Note: I'm not responsible if this damages your cd player....it works in my car fine but yours may be different.,3379,John Biehler

0,3218,Imperial 40mm Fan Guard,Seemed appropriate on Star Wars Day to remix the Star Wars Imperial logo with a 40mm fan guard for my Replicator 2. Also includes a raised logo in case you want to pause the print and swap filament at the 3mm point for a splash of color. Note I haven't printed this yet so I'm unsure if the logo interferes with the intake for the fan...will be testing it soon. I have an alternate (smaller logo) version I'll post if this one is problematic. Update It printed fine and seems to be a little quieter than my previous guard. I may reprint it in something other than black though...the LED lighting really hits it...something with extra UV might be cool.,3379,John Biehler
0,3219,Voronoi Cactus,"After seeing the results that DaniSaez got using Meshlab, I had to try making it with my scanned cactus model (hence the remix hat tip). I watched this video and applied the same filters to the cactus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWSeZk2IqHg I think it turned out pretty well...a few droopy strands on one side but otherwise very printable.",3379,John Biehler
0,3220,Camera cover for Google Glass,"Inspired by Luis' remixed version of the original, I trimmed it as well. Perfectly slides onto the Glass and keeps the prism clear.",3379,John Biehler
0,3221,Toilet Sign,"Couldn't find the kind of sign I was looking for so I made one. Starting with an SVG file from the web of the standard restroom icons of a man/woman, I then used DNewman's excellent Inkscape to OpenSCAD plugin to export the image to an STL (toilet-figures.stl). I've included the SCAD output as well. Then using Tinkercad.com, I put the figures on top of a rectangle to approximate the sign I was looking for. I've included both an outline version and a stacked 'extruded' version depending on how you'd like to print them. The outline version is pretty straightforward. The extruded version can be printed in two colors by pausing the print at the 4mm mark and swapping colors (I have a single extruder MakerBot Replicator 2). Tinker the extruded version or the outline version on Tinkercad.com",3379,John Biehler
0,3222,Printable Werewolf Deck,"Inspired by Max Temkin's take on the Werewolf card game, this is a simple printable version of the cards to make your own deck that I made in Tinkercad. I haven't printed these yet but they should print fine. I'll update the post once I've had a chance to print a set.",3379,John Biehler
0,3223,Low Poly Mexican Cactus,I've been kind of obsessing over printing low poly models lately so figured I should convert my own model. Decimated down to 500 faces in Meshlab. This model was featured on Tested.com's Mystery Build Friday which is pretty cool: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4kPt1HI_hg,3379,John Biehler
0,3224,Printrbot Simple Filament Guide,Was having problems with the filament drifting on the direct drive extruder of the Printrbot Simple (v2) so I merged the STL version of the laser cut parts and added an extension tube in Tinkercad. I'm still having issues with the filament not grabbing enough or too much and chewing it up but that's another problem to solve. This thing was made with Tinkercad.

0,3228,Printrbot Simple Z-Endstop Activator holder,I broke the lasercut parts for the Z axis endstop activator holder (see photo of wooden parts that hold the screw which triggers the endstop) while assembling my Printrbot Simple kit so I took the STL parts and merged them in Tinkercad to make a preassembled replacement. A perfect replacement although I did have to tap the holes to get them started but you could easily use a drill bit. This thing was made with Tinkercad.

0,3235,Cactus,"Using Jetty's awesome OmNomNom app, I was finally able to print a cactus from an iPhone photo of a plastic cactus I got from a party supply store years ago. I used the medallion option and edited the OpenSCAD to make the base=0. Also, I'm surprised this is the first (tagged) cactus on Thingaverse!",3379,John Biehler
0,3236,Vancouver Canucks logo,"Created via Jetty's awesome OmNomNom app (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:24639) from a jpg of the Canucks logo. I commented out the base from the OpenSCAD to make it just the logo. UPDATE: Uploaded a cleaned up, decimated and repaired file that should print much better.",3379,John Biehler
0,3237,XBee Explorer Dongle Case,Wanted a case for the Xbee Explorer Dongle from Sparkfun: http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9819 So I made one. This thing was made with Tinkercad. Edit it online https://tinkercad.com/things/epx6ZUHNISU,3379,John Biehler
0,3238,ToM Gen 4 Interface Kit cover,Wanted a cover to protect the top of the Gen 4 Interface Kit since it has the exposed ribbon cable wiring. This is the first version I attempted...gravity holds it in place and it's not level due to the acrylic plate angle. V2: wider top (covers the wood) and more of a cap than a cover Print whichever one you prefer. This part was made with Tinkercad. Edit the part online at: https://tinkercad.com/things/9r2sBLXVxv8 V2: https://tinkercad.com/things/5U7Wjh98Hsm,3379,John Biehler
0,3239,Prusa X-End Idler with snap fit LM8UU channel,"I printed the original version by DXBLouie but found I couldn't get my LM8UUs into the channel on the idler. I downloaded the SCAD files and think the problem was that the original configuration.SCAD file was set to the wrong bushing type. In any case, I changed the bushing type in configuration.SCAD and regenerated the STL for the idler and it appears to work now as I was able to snap in the LM8UUs. It's worth noting though that the LM8UUs I have (from Mixshop.ca) are shorter than the normal ones which may or may not make a difference. Anyways, I've included the updated SCAD files just in case anyone else runs into a similar issue.",3379,John Biehler
0,3240,Thing-O-Matic Camera Platform,"Using the excellent Tinkercad file by Physics Dude that this thing is derived from, it seemed like the perfect platform to attach a webcam to. I simply erased the unnecessary tool holder parts and put a tripod mount hole in the middle. I also made a larger platform that can move the camera further away from the print area if your webcam requires that or so you have a bigger surface to clamp just about anything onto. I have a Microsoft LifeCam that has a tripod mount point and used the mounting screw from a gorillapod that I normally use to shoot timelapses or simply remotely monitor the printer with. Feel free to adjust as necessary by making a copy in Tinkercad: Small: https://tinkercad.com/p/acc06bf989380100/53 Big: https://tinkercad.com/p/acc0eb3a3fe504be/19",3379,John Biehler

How to play:
Place the robot token on the last bend of the track.
Place the boy token on the start line.
Every time the boy finishes a question without help he moves forward.
Every time a teacher or parent tells the boy to get back on task the robot moves forward.
If the robot wins the game resets, if the boy wins he gets a treat.

My understanding is that late governor Robert ""Fighting Bob"" La Follete, sensing the future greatness of Packers football in the Badger State, slipped this requirement into the state constitution in 1902 after meeting the as-yet-unborn Vince Lombardi's mother in a Brooklyn pizzeria. We are nothing if not trendy and loyal to the green and gold here at Zheng Labs, and so we took a few hours off from publicizing our latest Kickstarter to create a 3D printable Packers-themed Robber that's compatible with Settlers of Catan.",10770,zheng3

0,4080,Finger Shark,"Hark! A new project appears on the horizon! Dungeon Blocks is the latest and greatest 3D printing Kickstarter from Zheng Labs! Give it a look and spread the word! Shark Tank? Shark Week? Sharknado? Pfah. Finger Shark. If you've ever done a 3D printing demo you've seen a dozen kids get all excited about the technology, watched your printer struggle to burp out a Yoda before the event ends, and then seen dejected kids walk away empty-handed. (A brief note to folks who do 3D printing demos: as of August 2014 there are more 3D printed Yodas in the world than there are children, so you can stop printing them now.) Never again, my friends. Finger Shark is fun, fashionable, and fabricates fast. Print a dozen to chum the waters at your next Maker event. Finger Shark is designed for a size 7 ring, which should snugly fit the fingers of most adults. You'll need to scale all three parts of Finger Shark to fit smaller fingers. To that end, the handy-dandy Zheng3 Ring Sizing PDF will help you teach a little basic algebra while the kids are printing finger sharks. (Another brief note to folks who do 3D printing demos: attempting to teach algebra during a demo may cause kids to shy away from your booth.)",10770,zheng3
0,4081,Zheng's Garden Guardian,"Summer (at last!) here in the north, and under the care of the lovely and talented Mrs. Zheng3 the grounds do bloom and shake off spring's clammy mantle. Irrigation is the order of the season, and polyurethane serpents dutifully follow our favorite chatelaine while she quenches the thirsts of young basils, zukes, and tomatoes. But she is busy, busy! and without a garden guardian's vigilance an overlooked dragon's tail might scythelike reap a row of tulips. It has happened before. Never again, my friends. Never. Again. Read about the remix and modeling process over at Zheng3.com, and see the post-production process on Instagram. Print in halves, sandwich around a #8 galvanized spike, and secure with your adhesive of choice. Here at Zheng Labs we are partial to Gorilla Glue for permanent applications.",10770,zheng3

I'm using these to safely store a few of the lovely and talented Mrs. Zheng3's coir baskets until she can transfer them, or, perhaps just as likely, cause them to be moved by some other agent, almost certainly me because our children are both lazy and short, onto their summer stations on the veranda. These hangers are designed to fit a 5/8"" (16mm) PVC pipe and have a hole and countersink for a drywall screw. Everything's Better With Drywall Screws. Includes a capped end and an open internal hanger. Scaling to fit other diameters of PVC is left as an exercise for the reader. Installation under heavy load or in areas prone to pronounced seismic activity is not recommended.",10770,zheng3
0,4083,Edsal Storage Unit Footing,"The lovely and talented Mrs. Zheng3's passion is gardening, and, vinelike, her hobby-but-so-much-more extends tendrils throughout our homestead every spring. Ere long the house and yard will be overrun and four months hence we will smother under bushels of heirloom tomatoes. Yesterday the garage was infiltrated by a new storage unit, soon to be stocked with chrysanthemum powder, mushroom compost, and myriad other eye-of-newtish polypropylene sacks with contents beyond my ken. Alas! The shelving arrived unshod, and past experience tells me that corner of the garage will most certainly flood with the first significant rain of the season, so to the printer we go to keep the unit's legs rust-free. This footing is designed for an Edsal Storage Rack, but will likely fit others with some finagling of scale. These racks are rated for two tons, so I recommend printing these footings at high infill.",10770,zheng3
0,4084,Spray Can Cap,"This. Everything the human race has been working towards in the last 10,000 years culminates in this, the single most useful object in the universe. Every advance in thermoplastics, every hour of every day and night spent by the original RepRap team, every moment of Edison's rejuvenating catnaps, every ellipse Newton drew, Euclid's scratches in the dust at Alexandria, agriculture, the first flake of flint noticed by a clever ape, each of these is a link in the unbroken chain of progress that leads to this model. Along with Archimedes, Turing, Salk, Berners-Lee, Stepanov, Von Liebig, and countless others who helped establish the infrastructure required to make this spray can top we must also credit Kelly Egan for creating the original model. I have modified Egan's opus and thereby assured my place in history by enlarging and directing the spray chamber. Until 3d printers are capable of sub-micron resolution, we must enable the spray by pushing a hot needle through the nozzle. The maximizing of aerosolization is left as an exercise for the reader.",10770,zheng3
0,4086,Tinkeriffic BB Bearing 58mm Spool Spindle,"Crikey. It's another Tinkeriffic bearing spool spindle. My Faire Play Kickstarter was funded to the tune of 120%, and now I'm printing backer rewards. I got myself a new roll of gold filament and of course it doesn't fit any of the bearings I've made so far, because that would make things easy and apparently Hera's mad at me for only making an Athena Makeover Kit. I'm cursed. A wiser man would take the time to create a Tinkeriffic bearing in Thingiverse's customizer, and then adjust bearings parametrically as needed. But Lao Zheng ain't got no time to be learnin' no Customizer, foo! So I banged this out in Maya in like eight seconds. Enjoy. This spool spindle is designed to fit a 58 mm spool, like this one I got from BuMat. This three-part solution (thirteen parts, if one counts the 4.5mm BB's) is designed to use a Tinkertoy rod as an axle and is a much, much smoother ride for your filament spools. I found inserting BB's into the original 608 bearing to be frustrating so I split the bearing in two and left it to the end user to super glue the parts together. The walls of the inner spool are by necessity quite thin; I recommend multiple shells or high infill for that part.",10770,zheng3
0,4087,Faire Play Recurve Bow,"On March 27, 2014, the Faire Play Kickstarter reached its fundraising goals with a fortnight to spare. As a thank you to our backers and media enablers, I've created the Faire Play Recurve Bow and Quiver. This bow is sculpted from organic, locally-sourced vertices, filtered and purified from the droppings of only the mimsiest free-range borogoves, and it'll fire a 6"" cosmetic swab across a room with dismissive ease. It's a two-piece print, so a little glue will be required before use. If Faire Play can reach its modest new stretch goal, I'll be re-sculpting the bow into a single-piece Shapeways print so that anyone can make their dolls deadly at range with a couple of clicks. One more time, huge thanks to everyone who has supported this project so far.",10770,zheng3
0,4088,Athena Makeover Kit,"Update 01/14/2015 A new Kickstarter appears! Announcing Faire Play 2: When in Rome.

Watch the Kickstarter video and share http://kck.st/1FQ7FZf with your social media pals! Sing, O muse, of science and of art and of trials and tessellation and tribulations, of dawn-laboring Zheng, and Barbie of the slim ankles. Acolytes rush to Delphi's shimmering pool to behold the emerging vision. Great Hera! A Kickstarter begins! UPDATE Faire Play was a sucess! The Kickstarter was overfunded and the Parade Armor is finished and on sale to the rest of the world. With Faire Play, I'm making 3D printed medieval armor for Barbie dolls. To the goddess of Wisdom I offer this Athena Makeover Kit as tribute, so that She may guide this campaign to success. Watch Barbie's debut in full battle gear in the Kickstarter video, and support Open Source design while you're there. The spear and aegis should clip on to pretty much any doll that's roughly Barbie-sized, but the boots are designed specifically for a doll in the Barbie Fashionistas line. I've got the prototype medieval armor finished and reliably printing on an FDM printer, now I just need to make it look fabulous.

I've long wanted to design a model that would be difficult to manufacture with traditional means. Most of the other bloxen I've designed could in theory be sculpted, injection-molded, or cast, but I'm thinking you'd have a hard time getting any of those processes to work for the Bramble Bloxen.

0,4094,Tinkeriffic BB Bearing 32mm Spool Spindle,"The original Tinkeriffic Spool Spindle (of 2012 vintage) functioned adequately, but was never a baby's-butt-smooth solution to my filament feeding fiascoes. This three-part solution (thirteen parts, if one counts the 4.5mm BB's) is designed to use a Tinkertoy rod as an axle and is a much, much smoother ride for your 32mm filament spools. I found inserting BB's into the original 608 bearing to be frustrating so I split the bearing in two and left it to the end user to super glue the parts together. The walls of the inner spool are by necessity quite thin; I recommend multiple shells or high infill for that part.",10770,zheng3
0,4095,Seej Avatar Pedestal,"This model introduces a new rule variant to Seej: Avatars.

Hats, helmets, tiarae, crowns, colanders, et cetera all qualify as legitimate headgear. Remember Core Rule #3 and don't attach your avatar's headgear too tightly. If the avatar's headgear falls off during the game, the player fielding the avatar immediately loses the match. Basic rules for Seej are at http://www.s33j.net.",10770,zheng3

0,4163,Intuition Pendant,"My inspiration for this pendant design is women in engineering. I think it would look most interesting as a multi-material or multi-color print in metals or plastic.
I want my design to empower young women entering challenging male-dominated fields such as engineering to maintain their femininity, positive attitude and self-confidence during their career journey. It will remind the wearer that they have the strength and skills needed to persevere and succeed.
I called it intuition because I believe women's intuition is an invaluable asset to the field of engineering. The organic shape of my pendant has been produced using structural topology optimization software from Altair called solidThinking Inspire and I rendered the result in solidThinking Evolve. I did not use the software provided for the competition. solidThinking is used by leading additive manufacturing companies and can be used to design everything from automotive and airplane components to buildings to consumer goods packaging.
Someday, I want women in technical fields to feel so comfortable in their work environment that it feels natural to everyone for them to be there. Personally, if I wore this pendant into a meeting, it would give me an interesting talking point with my customers. Recently, I exchanged 3d printed key chains with another female engineer, so it could also be a fun hobby to collect and trade 3d printed jewellery.",10614,jacquelyn

The lampshade he imagined has an aesthetic inspired by folded paper, the layers created by the M200 being so smooth they actually feel like a completely flat surface. The Susanna lamp can be used as a suspension or a table light. All you need to ad is an e27 socket with cable and an LED lightbulb to complete it.

0,4295,Floating arm trebuchet (dimes and pennies),"This trebuchet uses a floating arm rather than a fixed arm. That means that the weights can fall completely vertical resulting in a more efficient and powerful throw compared to standard trebuchet designs. See a test firing shot here: http://i.imgur.com/9QZHuB0.gif
Assembly should be fairly straight forward. You will need 2 toothpicks and 2 and 10-15cm of string along with the 3d printed parts. You need to print two of the weight, the stand, and the wheel. Everything else just print 1. You will need to orient each shape properly as I did not build them on the plane they were to be printed at.
I printed the parts at 0.025mm height with 0.05mm width. Some parts are small and are exactly 1mm in width so these settings ensure that they match up exactly with no small gaps.
side1 and side2 should pushed together until they are flush. This might be a bit hard, but this is to ensure that they stay in place and will not come apart. I used a small vice to push pins together that I couldn't get with my hands. The stands just snap on to the assembled frame.
The sling should just snap together. Once the 2 halves are together make sure they swing freely. If they do not you may need to make some small edits to the file to get the piece configured correctly for your printer. These are small pieces so some variation may occur. The current size of the hole and pin worked great for me. The hinge stays together and swings loosely so the coin can fly out with no resistance.
For the arm take one of your toothpicks and cut it in half. One half will be your firing pin so save that for later. With the other half but it down to 9mm in length. This goes through the hole that is second from the top of the arm (top being the thickest end of the arm). Next push the two wheels, one to each end of the toothpick. The other toothpick secures the weights and the arm to the frame. It goes through one vertical slit, then through the top most hole of the arm, the through the far slit. Once this is done you can slide the weights onto each side and fill the weights with dimes. You could increase the size of the weight holders if you want to use pennies or some other denomination.
For the string...one piece goes through the bottom most hole of the arm and then through one of the string holes on the sling. Another piece of string must be made into a loop on one end and the attached to the other string hole on the sling. When loaded, the sling should be about in the center of the frame with the strings taut. Too long and it will not have enough power to swing the strings, too short and it will throw your coins into the ground every time. Experiment a bit to find that sweet spot.
If you have any trouble just look up how trebuchets work and you should be able to sort it out.",11240,Andrew Claasen
0,4296,A Visit To Paris,"The theme for this design is a Parisian pendant. This powerhouse of fashion and haute couture provides rich inspiration in terms of shapes and styles with its rich history and architecture. The challenge is how to produce something instantly recognizable and yet retain a freshness and uniqueness in the design. The method? take something iconic, destroy it and reconstruct it taking it in a new direction. The skyline of Paris is dominated by the majestic Eiffel tower conjured from rivets and wrought iron, braced with beams and trusses, a slender yet masculine aesthetic. Another Parisian specialty is the flowing wrought iron gates with beautiful floral patterns decorating many public buildings. Combining these elements and crowning them with a warm rose gold hue this pendant is instantly familiar yet altogether different, a fitting homage to the city of lights.

0,4298,Pi Bracelet,"The Pi Bracelet is made up of 9 interlocking links, each with a couple of digits of Pi on it - a total of 14 digits after the decimal (3.14159265358979) and one link with the Pi symbol. Each link is approx 16mm square not including the linkage - and the complete set of links, when connected as  bracelet, measures approx 215mm long - fitting an adult average wrist pretty well. Links can be left off to make the design smaller. The whole design can be scaled down to make it work better on kids' wrists. The image shows an 80% and 100% version.
Link Design:  The links connect using a custom design which makes it mostly easy to connect, but harder to fall apart. To connect the links, you put them at a 90 degree angle to one another, with the male/pin portion under the female/mortise portion - pushing the pin into the mortise and then straightening the pair until they click in. Separate using the opposite motion. There is often some brim material on the bottom of the model which needs to be worn down before the connection can be made easily - but this actually helps to keep the connection firm and secure.
It might take some connecting and un-connecting to make the pairs of links move and flex freely to lay comfortably on your wrist.

This version was created in Cubify Invent and is made available as a .FUN file as well as an STL file.",11637,Richard Gain
0,4489,Bangle Bearing,"I always have a copy of Emmett's brilliant Gear Bearing out on the coffee table - it's such a great talking point and introduction to 3D printing - and recently someone I showed it to suggested it might make an interesting bangle. I'm not sure about its fashion-worthiness, but as a printing challenge I thought it was an excellent idea. I had already used an idea by Sal to print gear bearings with large circular holes instead of small hexagonal ones (http://www.thingiverse.com/make:26306), so I just took this up to the next level. I have posted the modified .scad file so the design is still fully parametric, and also a copy of the STL file that works with the tolerances on my printer. Here is the video of the bangle working as a gear bearing (but not as a fashion item!) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt39vLo5l90",11637,Richard Gain
0,4490,PifPaf with Turn by Gregory Benedetti,The four identical pieces of this interlocking puzzle make up a 5x5x3 cuboid. Gregory Benedetti is the designer of this puzzle and the plans are freely available on Puzzle Will Be Played. The pieces of this puzzle would impossible to print on a RepRap without support enabled. So instead I split the main shaft in two and used LockBlock connectors to join them back together (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:27695).,11637,Richard Gain
0,4491,Four Mirror One puzzle by Osanori Yamamoto,"This is a fantastic puzzle! It's not too easy, nor is it too hard to solve. It comes from the mind of a brilliant Japanese puzzle inventor called Osanori Yamamoto, whose Bisect Cube puzzle was one of the first things I uploaded to Thingiverse. Not only are all his designs very clever puzzles, but many of them are also ideally suited to 3D printing as they require no additional support. The puzzle consists of one ring shaped piece and four identical T pieces. These must be assembled with the Ts arranged in a mirrored pairing as shown in the photo. The design was downloaded from the Puzzle Will be Played website at http://www.puzzlewillbeplayed.com/643Ring/FourMirrorOne/",11637,Richard Gain
0,4492,Tetradyma by Yavuz Demirhan,Yavuz Demirhan is a prolific Turkish puzzle inventor with nearly150 published designs at Puzzle Will Be Played ( http://puzzlewillbeplayed.com/-/designer/Demirhan.xml ). Tetradyma is one of his latest and is unusual in that it requires four identical pieces to fit into a cube shape. It is also printable without needing any support material. I would rate it as tricky but not difficult - a great design to give to novice puzzlers.,11637,Richard Gain
0,4493,Printable Interlocking Puzzle #3 - Level 4 by Bram Cohen,"I am proud to present a new Printable Interlocking Puzzle Cube, but this time I didn't design it. Following the release of PIP#2, I was contacted by Bram Cohen (puzzle designer and author of the BitTorrent protocol) asking whether I had found any printable interlocking puzzle cube designs with a level higher than 1, i.e. needing more than a single move to take the first piece out. This sounded like a great challenge and I set about about trying to design one but then Bram beat me to it - not once but twice. As Bram commented in his email, "" the main thing causing difficulties is that the printed bottom of the pieces can't be facing the outside directly, because then they can just be pulled off as the first move, but because the bottom must by definition have the most voxels, putting those on the interior makes it very hard to fill up all the external voxels and not stuff shut the internal voxels."" His first attempt was a level 2 puzzle cube but that was quickly superseded by this very clever level 4 design. EDIT: (23/12/2014) Thanks to a great piece of work by mateddy (see http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:569118) I can finally make this puzzle available in OpenSCAD format.",11637,Richard Gain
0,4494,Printable Interlocking Puzzle #2,"Designed on Christmas Day 2012, here is the second of my series of printable interlocking puzzles, and this time it's a 4x4x4 cube. 'Printable' means no support material required. 'Interlocking' means the puzzle pieces fit together only in the correct sequence and will not fall apart when the puzzle is moved. This puzzle is much more challenging than PIP#1 so I will be happy to provide a solution on request, if you need it. Update: The solution video is at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNIwRid7390",11637,Richard Gain
0,4495,Earbud shell with support,I love the design of sneakypoo's Earbud holder but I don't like turning on support in my slicer.

This way you can print the shells with nice nubs without turning on support.,11637,Richard Gain
0,4496,Printable Interlocking Puzzle #1,This is my brand new interlocking puzzle design that should print perfectly on a well tuned printer. It consists of three pieces and makes a 3x3x3 cube.

0,4499,Ducted 60 mm fan for Mendel90,"I printed a selection of fan ducts for my Mendel90. Some of them didn't fit and others just didn't work, so I designed my own. I have copied some of the best features from other designs and merged them into a model that will fit on the Mendel90 using a couple of adapters for mounting. Update - April 2013 - my original fan duct was getting a little overheated so I finally got around to redesigning a slightly longer version which centres the nozzle better. Update 2 - the all-metal E3D hot end needs a cooling fan and shroud fitted to it. There was not enough space to fit this so I have released an updated low-profile version at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:91931",11637,Richard Gain
0,4500,Crouching Woman by Auguste Rodin,"This dramatic statue is in the Hirshhorn Sculpture Garden in the Washington DC mall. http://dcmemorials.com/index_indiv0000455.htm I selected it partly for the interesting subject matter and partly because it looked pretty printable, with no serious overhangs. I took 30 high resolution photos from all around the statue and uploaded them using 123D Catch to make the model.",11637,Richard Gain
0,4501,Lockblock - printable connector,"Many puzzle pieces have complex shapes with inevitable overhangs whichever way you orient them. I would like to try soluble support material but I don't yet have dual extruder printing capability. Ordinary support material leaves nasty marks on the downward-facing surfaces. My latest idea was to split the piece horizontally through the middle and print the two halves facing upwards with a custom connecting joint on top of each piece. The joint consists of a triangular peg next to a triangular hole, all contained within the outline of a single cube. The prototype was first modelled in Tinkercad and then transferred to OpenSCAD for easier customisation. Watch the video of the first test at http://youtu.be/Fp63gR9HTJA",11637,Richard Gain

0,4509,Mendel90 adapter for herringbone gears,"I really wanted to be able to use Triffidhunter's parametric herringbone gears ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10707 ) as recommended by Richrap, but they were just too tall to fit on my X-carriage. This adapter will raise the Wade's block by 2 mm which is just enough to allow the large gear to fit. Read more at http://mynext3dprinter.tumblr.com",11637,Richard Gain
0,4510,Bobbins for intarsia,"When I had the privilege of meeting nophead and his good lady last month, one of the questions I was asked was whether I had made lots of useful things for my wife. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I had only made her a keyring, so far. My opportunity came yesterday when she asked me for help with a specific problem. My wife enjoys making things as well but her filaments are more of the sewing and knitting variety. Recently, she has been experimenting with a kind of knitting called intarsia, which calls for lots of different coloured strands of wool to be in use at the same time to build a picture. You'll get the idea from this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7G4yzCzpHk (skip to 3:30 to see the bobbins). I designed the basic shape in Tinkercad and then did a bit of tweaking in Blender. She was delighted with the result and now understands how useful my expensive new toy can really be.",11637,Richard Gain
0,4511,Cube Libre puzzle,This a great little puzzle by Mineyuki Uyematsu that I saw on Puzzle Will Be Played last week. http://puzzlewillbeplayed.com/444/CubeLibre/ It's another great example of a printable puzzle that requires no support on RepRap printers. These 10 puzzle pieces can make both an 8x8 square and a 4x4x4 cube. I designed a special box in Tinkercad that allows the puzzler to play both games. https://tinkercad.com/things/8Jzfov4OYUA,11637,Richard Gain
0,4512,Bisect Cube puzzle by Osanori Yamamoto,"I love designing, making, solving and collecting interlocking 3D puzzles. I have lots in my microcubology shop on Shapeways site but most of them will not print well on current RepRap machines because of the need for tight tolerances and support material for overhanging blocks. I discovered this brand new puzzle here http://puzzlewillbeplayed.com/553Ring/BisectCube/ at the excellent 'Puzzle Will Be Played' website and immediately realised that it was printable on my new eMaker Huxley machine. It took three goes to get the tolerances right but this version prints just right for me. I have based the puzzle on 10 mm cubes and used a 0.2 mm offset on every face.",11637,Richard Gain

You will need the following:
2 CDs glue or double-sided tape A threaded bolt 1/2"" long or slightly longer with a thread diameter of 1/4"" or less
A corresponding nut
2 washers (optional but recommended)
Print in ABS or PLA at 15% infill. The base and top need to be printed with a diameter of 6 inches. The base is 1/4"" high and the top is 1/2"" high. If you want a lazy susan without a lip on the edge, just print another base, instead of the top.
The large indentation is for the CDs. Glue or tape the label side of the CD to the indentation. The shiny side of the CDs are facing each other when the top and base are put together. Run the bolt through the center hole and tighten. The CDs are very low friction and will allow the spice rack to rotate without the use of ball bearings.

Building off of my previous modular spaceship building sets, I've incorporated magnets to allow for fast and and easy reconfiguration. This set contains the basic components needed for a small ship, and these basic components will be interchangeable with new parts that are coming soon. Note: you will need 5 mm magnetic balls to complete this assembly. I use the (now illegal) BuckyBall magnets that everyone seems to have on their desks. Because the parts are scaled for 5 mm magnets, you could potentially re-size the model to fit different magnets (4 mm magnets - scale to 80%, 6 mm magnets - scale up 120% and so on). IMPORTANT: BuckyBalls (and similar magnetic toys) were taken off the market for a very good reason! Small, powerful magnets are extremely hazardous when ingested and can result in serious injury, particularly for small children.

I printed everything with 2 shells and 10% infill. Make sure you use at least two shells on the drip tray so it doesn't leak.

UPDATE 3/19/15: I made a silver version with an extrude subtract by .6mm. The total thickness is 1mm. You can see that the Redbird logo is subtracted all the way through. I also increased the text size quite a bit. UPDATE 3/25/15: I was able to get red text on top with a nice transition. I added a square off the the side so I could change the filament while it was filling the box. The last picture shows the current version.

backstory:
After working in the retail fashion world selling designer brands for a number of years, I decided to become a designer myself. Last year I started up a handcrafted jewelry business. Since my husband is an engineer, and introduced me to 3D printing I slowly began adding 3D printed items to my jewelry line. Surfing the web for inspiration for developing more 3D printed jewelry I came across the Pinshape/ Elle Time & Jewelry Design Competition.
what inspired it:
I was inspired to create a sophisticated necklace pendant for this competition by the modern, sleek necklace pendants on the Elle Time & Jewelry website.",10821,shari.henning.12

Story Behind: 
 The design is base form the character of Maria Clara in the novel entitled 'Noli Me Tangere', which was written by a Filipino national heroe Dr. Jose Rizal. The story was all about Spain and Philippines as their colony base on an actual Philippine history during 1800's. Within the story, she is a girlfriend of Krisostomo Ibbara (Dr. Jose Rizal's depicted character in the novel), the epitome of virtue, ""demure and self-effacing"" and endowed with beauty, grace and charm, and ideal image of a woman who deserves to be placed on the ""pedestal of male honour"". Maria Clara (Leonora Rivera in real life) was actually a real life girlfriend of Dr. Jose Rizal. Until the present time, the name Maria Clara was then emulates character's traits of being delicate, feminine, self-assured and with a sense of identity. 
Design Structure:
 It's hard to make a stunning design specially when the designed is just a monochromatic color and is not required to put some precious stone. So I isolated a small sphere on the center to create an illusion of something like a precious stone at the center. Plus an engraved letter M on it stands for Maria and C shape of the whole ring structure stands for Clara. And i also put some wavy minimal designs to emphasize its feminism even more.",11693,Lomell Rueca

Marketability: Not only woman will love the design. This will be in demand specially also by guys who want a special gifts for their loved ones, crushes, and for the girls they are courting with. This will be a very clear message that she's the one for the guy. An apple of the eye.
Story Behind:
The concept in simply. As have been said to the title, it's an apple of the eye. It refers to something or someone that one cherishes above all others.
In Old English, the pupil of the eye (the round, dark center) was called the 'apple'. It was thought that the pupil was a round object much like an apple (a piece of fruit). When you look at someone, their reflection appears in your pupil. So if someone is the 'apple of your eye', he or she is someone that you look at a lot and enjoy seeing. 
Also, base on some surveys that have been already conducted by some experts, boys are much easier to fall in love with women so it was really indeed that women are the most qualified to hold the title of being an apple of the eye in planet among genders.
Design Structure:
The gold red (apple) represents the pupil of the eye while the silver are the aye lashes. An illusion of eye will appear when you turn it 90 degree counter clock wise. I decided to turn the apple into gold (red) color to say even more profound that women are the most precious and loved ones by us boys :)

0,4757,Ocean Pearl Necklace,"Intro
As a concept designer and toy modeler working in the games industry I always start my creative thinking process by putting down words and ideas on paper before picking up the pencil.
Idea behind the design
For this jewelry contest my initial idea was to base the design on the the theme of water, choosing words like “pearl”, “ocean waves”, “movement” and “water drops”. (Not sure if this is just me wanting to be summer already :D)
Water is a symbol of purity and is the source of life. Pearls are simple in shape and whitish/silverish and are considered the gemstone of kings, pharaohs, emperors and gods. Waves are symbol of free spirit and motion/movement. You will see all these incorporated in my final design. 
I think every woman will want to portray these things, so why not saying it with this jewelry?
Design Phase
I usually design creatures and character but this time it was really fun to try thinking of something as aesthetic as a women’s jewel.
Right after the idea stage I started with rough sketches and thumbnails.
As a 3d artist I believe a design is not thoroughly figured out and completed not until it is realized in 3d. So I did 3d mockup models based on the three sketches I liked the most. The 3d mockups help to see the design from all angles and to spot out any problems and to evaluate it whether it will be hard to 3d print, whether the actual molding process will be possible or complicated.
After I narrowed my choice and focus on only one design that I think is very effective and at the same time easy to produce – I did a second stage of concept design – several variants of the same thing trying out different shapes and motives. Usually I do this by overpainting a screenshot of the 3d mockup model.
Then I created the final 3d model following the refined design and make it 3d printable.
Prototyping Phase
As this is a design for a physical product I didn’t want to stop at the digital stage. There is no better evaluation tool than having a 3d printed model in your hand. I contacted a local 3d printing service and few days later I received the test models I send them. I tested different sizes, versions with cutouts or with no cutout parts and different depth.
I didn’t want to call this done (since it was so fun and exciting to see the design coming to life) and took the decision to manufacture it for real. Make it real or go home (bro! :D). So I did a silicone mold using the 3d print.Then cast it from wax and post-processed it a bit. Finally I and gave it to a friend, who was able to cast it from silver.
Best Phase
The best part of this whole new and exciting experience for me was the photo shoot … where the gorgeous model Aneta wore my design around her neck! :D
Outro
It was a really fun and wonderful experience and I enjoyed every single step from design to rapid-prototyping to molding and presentation.
This is my first ever jewelry design, but I liked the process so much in fact that I think it won’t be my last one! I appreciate your time. Thank you for reading this presentation.

Story Behind:
 The rose has 4 different colors (red, white, pink, blue) with a unique meaning of each. Red is the most popular one as we know. It shows love, respect, passion and courage which are the usual traits among woman. Though, we may call it also a white rose if we choose to make it in silver version only.
Design Structure:
 Rose is commonly use in decorations and in jewelry design. But the problem is how will a designer incorporate such common elements into something new and unique. So here it is. I combined it with a contemporary style of design placing the rose beneath the center of the piece. Simple and plane looking design of the top piece helps the rose stands out even more than just the flower only existing in design",11693,Lomell Rueca

0,4796,Water Drop Collection - Pendant,"Before I started to design this jewelry I had to consider all conditions.
First of course was ELLE style, what it exactly means. It should speak to feminine, positive and self-confident women so I started from this.
Self-confident – When I am thinking about jewelry for this kind of woman it means for me that it should be conspicuous, so quite big, massive.
Positive – it means that it can not be too massive and big, so I should make something interesting for this conspicuous effect, something more gentle.
Feminine – it means that it should show and emphasize beauty of woman. For this purpose jewelry should use smooth shapes (for me it works better than other kind of shapes).
Because it should be in ELLE style, there was also one more condition – it should be completly different than anything before.
Last condition was that it should not include a stone in the design.
After that I could start making drawings.
In sum it should be conspicuous, but in very gentle way, emphasize the beauty of woman, has smooth shape, has no stone and be completly new, and of course be easy to produce. OK – that is nice challenge.
I decided to use two kind of gold. After many drawings I decided to make collection with main theme – drop of water. Why this kind of theme? During drawing there was a little rain outside and I thought that I will try with this one. I drew a few concepts and I decided that it works perfect for me. Drop was made from white gold, rest from yellow. I made ring, pendant and earrings. To show what kind of effect is given by a full collection I attach a picture of all designs together.
All parts are easy to print and later easy to make wax models for bigger production.

A backstory up to the bracelet:
Weeks prior to discovering this contest, I was sketching out these little rings and bangles, just for fun. I never did anything like that before. The practice was highly therapeutic. The moment I saw an email alerting me to this contest, I was excited, and made pages of designs. My jaw would drop every time my eyes looked at what appeared to be ""simple"" jewelry, it was so exciting that jewelers should be so skilled at something as ""seemingly simple"" as line, shape and form...it almost comedic!
I came to understand that the master jewelers deeply understood the *WHY* behind the art of jewelry, as it involved hours of lecture, communication, a library of books...studies of shapes, patterns, psychology, symbols and their meanings. Perhaps it's easier than I realize? Right brain love? Nonetheless I'm just happy to see a line turned into some cosmic shape.
Intimidated? YES!!! But the process was worth it, and I had to try!
Originally, I had sketches with the moon as a primary theme, as a pendant. I think the bangle has done better justice.
The WHY:
The process was arduous. No pattern in my mind, sketched, and modeled could justify how important it was in making the perfect bangle. There were far too many variables for me to understand, but what I did understand, and what was easy for me, was just to keep it simple, and use the importance of the word to evoke meaning. I understood, from observing Elle, that it was important to AUGMENT the physical and mental attributes of the wearer themselves, not divert from them.
Also - jewelry can be a token of power, a talisman, something dear to the wearer. Hence the message. An ordinary bracelet to be worn with others...or so it seems.
Through introspection and the will, to acquire knowledge, and having the strength to carry it out in the face of opposition - I wanted this to be conveyed. I want to see women (and men!) surpass and triumph in their darkest moments - if this bracelet can aid in that desire, then my job is done, bangle is a go.
It is not the best design, but I know at least to me, it is a valuable one, perhaps one that will be improved upon in the future.

0,4890,Wray Catus,"This was a line of jewelry items based on one skeleton of a prickly pear cactus. What got me into 3d printing. Tried to do it straight from the skeleton to burn out but it never survived well so modeled a version and printed it in pla and burnt out haven't look back since. 
To print you can use your printers standard or settings or to get a bit of texture leave off the top layer or mess with the bed height to get some different textures and patterns. Change the scale for earrings or other pieces. to make the cuff print the design then use hot water or a heat gun to shape it to your wrist. 
If you Print in pla you can go to a foundry and burn it out. It will shrink a bit with this around 5% depending on metal mix. Also you can eletroform over the pla for light large pieces. 
My next design with this line is mixing resin and stone dust for some of the holes. Some what like the water it store to survive in such a hot climate. Hope you like it. First time using this site.

La femminilità, l’essere donna: questa l’idea di partenza.
Il cambiamento, la diversità e le mille sfaccettature di un essere misterioso e, allo stesso tempo, affascinante sono le linee guida che hanno dato vita ad un gioiello come lo Spectrum.
Un gioiello che diventa simbolo di qualcosa, più grande e più profondo, inesprimibile come solo la sensibilità di una donna può esserlo. Un gioiello che non va semplicemente indossato, ma capito, interpretato, ritmo e movimento si fondono dando vita ad una superficie variabile, ora pacata ora concitata. Sensazioni contrastanti, ma fondamentali, che bene rappresentano la donna e le sue emozioni.
Tutto questo è espresso perfettamente da un anello, simbolo intramontabile di quella femminilità alla quale Spectrum trova la sua fonte di ispirazione.

All this is perfectly expressed by a ring, a symbol of that timeless femininity which Spectrum finds its source of inspiration.

The shape of the Chinese character for 8 (八) implies that a person will have a great, wide future as the character starts narrow and gets wider toward the bottom.

0,4963,Hidden Pocket,"I love wearing dresses and skirts, especially when going out. However, these clothes often don't have any pockets. No place for money, keys or cards. It's okay if you like to drag a bag everywhere you go, or you have a boyfriend with pockets that volunteers as living bag that also has to go everywhere you want to. But I don't like bags when I'm dancing. And I don't like stuffing my bra with coins. It looks so ordinary, grabbing in you bra to pay for you drink. I even tried putting things in my boots, adviced by a friend. That resulted in us both standing next to the bar, taking of a boot to search for some coins that had bothered my toes the whole time I was dancing. It was not a look I liked. So I designed these hidden pockets, available in two different sizes. The small pockets are hidden under clothing or inside a booth, while the outer part is decorated and looks nice. The large pocket can fit cards, while the medium pocket can fit keys and coins. It's discreet, practical and pretty.",8473,Daphne Laméris

The Mine Cart plugs on the top of the motorized train engine so you can make it go on the tracks. Steve and his chest will fit in the cart. You can put any block in the cart. This is a work in progress. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Kh8XZlD6kM Another train to use with Minecraft is an older train made in Germany by Fuller.

The blocks to make the Minecraft Tree I uploaded can be used to build a house for Steve if you print a bunch of them. Each regular block is 1.5 inches. The other blocks are 2 or 3 blocks long and a large block is 3x3x1 block in size. (1.5 inches or 3.81cm) If you want to save time get some wooden blocks to use with the plastic blocks. I am working on a Minecraft house. It will be made of parts that you use to build your house for Steve.,10957,David Mc

Best to paint the tree trunk before you glue it all together. This tree is scale to the Minecraft figures being sold in stores. I print everything I upload. The new files with 1111 and 222 are made thinner to save time printing. If you are scaling the tree down then use the thicker files. This tree will be 5 blocks high when put together.

0,5038,Stanford Easter Bunny - Voronoi,"Hi all, I needed a cool mesh to test some true voronoi patterns. And in the spirit of Easter; the Stanford Bunny seemed like the perfect subject! The cell-center distribution for the voronoi patterns was generated using charge particle simulations: The particles can move freely within a 1mm thick voxel model of the bunny. They repel and attract each other. And over time they form a near perfect distribution across the surface. Next, the 1mm wide voronoi pattern was generated within the same 1 mm thick voxel model, resulting in round 1mm wires. And finally the voxel model was polygonized using a marching cubes algorithm, and cleaned using VCG lib functions. Stanford_Bunny - Voronoi pattern stl Is based on single charges, producing a smooth distribution and a honeycomb like pattern. Stanford_Bunny - Voronoi2 pattern stl Is based on sets of 2 linked charges, or lines actually. This produces slightly elongated cells. Resulting in a more more crackly pattern. And although it is not a derivative, hat-tip to Roman Hegglin's ""Stanford Bunny Voronoi style"": http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:291323 Happy Easter everyone!

Installation: 1 - Remove the two tabs fixed to the front of the plate. 2 - Replace the two stock brackets with the two you just printed. (You may want to put a thin coat of rubber cement on the bottom of the bracket to keep it from rotation when leveling the bed.) 3 - Get a piece of thin double sided 3M tape (not foam tap). you will want one side to stick to the bracket and work the side towards the glass so that it's just tacky and doesn't ad here to the glass plate.

0,5107,Arduped Biped Robot,"After seeing a couple really cool examples of ""four degrees of freedom"" biped out there, I decided that I would make some cool feet and make the robots a bit more creature-like. Current ideas for cool feet are beasty feet, mech-like feet, rock feet.. you know. The preceding examples of this type of robot used the pcb as the mounting point for the servos, and I've made a generic baseplate with room for a mini breadboard or your own preferred platform. I've also added a ""neck"" servo for looking around and ultrasonic sensor for sight. I plan to make a housing and more creature feet for this as there is much potential for customization. The code I'm using is a derivation of the functions and primitives written for uBipedino (tm) by user Ro-Bot-X on the Let's Make Robots site.

Or, you could just print one and look at it ;) From Wikipedia: As part of the rebuilding, it was decided to erect a permanent memorial of the Great Fire near the place where it began. Sir Christopher Wren, Surveyor General to King Charles II and the architect of St. Paul’s Cathedral, and his friend and colleague, Dr Robert Hooke, provided a design for a colossal Doric column in the antique tradition. They drew up plans for a column containing a cantilevered stone staircase of 311 steps leading to a viewing platform. This was surmounted by a drum and a copper urn from which flames emerged, symbolizing the Great Fire.

0,5143,Replicator 2 Fan Duct revisited,"I've recently been printing using NinjaFlex (which is brilliant BTW). On angled thin walled prints, the Replicator 2 output cooling fan would sometimes push the filament to the right causing it miss the layer below. I wanted to remedy this by having the air come from both sides. My previous version of the fan duct suffered on some machines by being too low and as it was supported on one side, would hang down on the right. I realised that I could support the duct by clipping it on both sides of the carriage. I started out by making something that would clip on, then I attached it to the fan and then added the air ducts. The first attempt enclosed the heating element too much and was too low. After printing for about three hours, a PLA version of the final design started to soften in the middle which meant that the clips at the sides became loose. I reprinted it in T-Glass and for good measure, I applied some copper tape to dissipate some of the heat. The one photographed (blue) has printed continuously for 10 hours at 250 degrees (Nylon) and shows no signs of melting. It was cool to the touch when I removed it after the print. I have marked this as work-in-progress as I have only used it for a few days and it may need adjusting. Some air flow analysis would certainly help, but I'm afraid I don't have any such tools :( so I'll have to settle for the empirical approach... Unless you can help? Update I found the airflow from the small holes was too powerful, I've produced a version with wider holes that is more gentle whilst still providing air from 3 sides. Another Update! Fisk4 asked if I could widen it for the people who've bought the Aluminium upgrade, apparently the body is 1.5 mm wider. So I've uploaded a version for that.

Crafts then stood next to the sheriff and read it from the balcony in a stentorian tone. For most people, it was a festive occasion, as about two-thirds of Boston residents supported the revolution.

If your shelf is smaller or larger you might want to edit the .step files and change the angle of the rods. (Sorry, i'm not an openscad kind of thinker, heh) I also wanted a way to easily change spools (I keep my spares bagged up so they do not absorb Seattle moisture.)

0,5246,Linear Bearing Y Axis Carriage for ToM,"ToM Y Axis Carriage for Linear bearings LMB6UU (3/8"") This is really just a little project that I've been fiddling with over the last few months when I have a moment to spare. Purely for my own enjoyment (yes, I know, I should get out more), but you are welcome to try if you wish. I'm sure there are a whole raft of engineers ready to tell me that this is wrong in so many ways and I look forward to being enlightened by their candid observations and everyone's improvements & modifications. For anyone who'd like to try it, it really is a work-in-progress and although it works quite happily at 50mm/s feed rate, it is not yet what I would consider finished. This version requires an X carriage of its own because I've centred the X pulley. As it sits lower on the rods, it gives you > 126mm on the Z axis, so you'll need to place your HBP very high to stop the Z stage falling off the lead screw. (I'll make it ride higher in the next version which will give the stepper more clearance over the bed as well). I should have moved the Y limit switch but to save any hassle I added a long arm to the centre section that operates it in its current position. I also think the X limit switch should be moved to the side of the carriage to clear the pulley bolt. I ended up using 4 bearings although I started out with 3. The inertia of the motor side is too great for the bearings on the right to stop the carriage twisting, I think I may try moving the motor to the right and go back to 3 in a later version. I also intend to move the bearings closer together and remove more material from the base of the carriage to make it lighter. I'll post some photos of it installed when I get a chance.",12852,MakeALot

To protect the surface you can wire brush, annodise and dye....google it. The rudder has a tapered shaft entry, 8mm tapering to 4mm diameter over a length of 60mm. There's also an indentation for drilling and tapping a grub screw but it's better to cut some gripping notches into the SS rudder shaft and cast the aluminium around it. Look up sand casting and get hold of silica sand and bentonite clay, make a moulding box of greater inside dimensions than the fin outside dimensions. Alternatively you can make a mould around it and then cast carbon fibre etc with some low viscosity epoxy resin. Try to find a supplier of infusion moulding resins for best wetting out characteristics. You can also scale the rudder in your slicing program to use in a plane for tail, wing or rudder sections. As a wing, it will provide neutral lift so it's best in an acrobatic plane needing to fly well either side up.",4962,Fluidity

They also blow the cure time out over an hour depending on how much you add...

0,5448,eMaker Huxley modified Z endstop,"This is my first attempt at a modification to my printer and I'm pretty pleased with it. I love printing with my Huxley - http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5631 - but one of the frustrations is the major impact on print quality with even minor variation in the height of the nozzle when printing the first layer. I use spark plug feeler gauges to set the height to 0.2 mm for a 0.3 mm layer height but I found the method of adjusting the Z-endstop didn't give me the level of control I wanted. So I replace the old bracket with a new longer one; I found an old 6 mm hex head bolt with a couple of nuts that fitted; I added a couple of parametric thumbwheels - http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13807; and finally, I designed a new bracket to fit on the side of the X-motor bracket.",11637,Richard Gain

0,5468,Counterpoint,"In music, counterpoint is the overlaying of independent rhythms and contours with the intention of creating harmony in their relationships. Inspired by this principle, this necklace design composes four kinds of elements as the prototypes to express the energy in their relationships.
In the pendent part of the necklace, I focused on designing the interactive relationship of the overall gesture. Each element gradually changes in size and shape while each comes from one of four original shapes. In the parts around the neck, there is one “rhythm” shape that repeats to complete the necklace. 3D printing technology provides us with the chance to produce interlocking parts. I want to explore the aesthetics of using this unique ability to design something that looks delightful, not only in the shapes themselves, but also when the parts involve each other. With this design, I want to express the elements playing together!

0,5469,Mahuika,"Mahukia is the name of the Māori fire deity, whose spirit I wanted to express in the silver reflections, evocative of glistening flames, which are visible in the movable structure of this necklace.
Every element is designed thoughtfully as an individual form and also as part of an overall gesture to be draped around the neck. This necklace intends to show a system for taking advantage of 3D printing technology while treasuring the traditional silver casting and polishing techniques.
The design is composed of linking one-of-a-kind elements which will adjust to the wearer’s body. Because all the elements are separate, they can be cast and polished to a beautiful finish. Additionally, elements can be added or removed to reach a desired length.
With this necklace I hope to integrate the uncompromising form allowed by 3D printing with the passionate spirit of fine silver craftsmanship.
* * * * * After several 3D printed mock-ups and adjusting the form back and forth between the software and physical models, the result is ready to manufacture and wear. How to assemble: (See the uploaded image: Assembling description) Each element has a raised number embossed on the back. To link them together, loop element 1 to element 2, then 2 to 3, and so on until 19 (use -1 to -19 for the opposite side). After linking them, elements 19 and -19 will connect to element 0, completing the chain. How to wear: Unhook the element between 1 and -1. Put the necklace around the neck, and hook elements 1 and -1 back on the necklace again. ( Attending competition purpose. Not for sale.)",14623,han-yin hsu

I designed this Jewelry Set for a Steampunk Festival held annually in Waltham MA and the Box is the product of a North Shore 3D Printing Club project involving Nathaniel Hawthorne's personal snuff box on display in Salem MA.
This item has been the subject of some ""Role Play in Design"" Lightning Lectures in reference to the design process. To summarize, an artisan character ""found"" a gear ( I designed a gear in virtual space ) then the artisan character decided to re-purpose the gear into a jewelry set to trade at the local market ( I broke the virtual gear into 3 pieces and added holes or extruded planes to form a jewelry set ). As the character incarnate, I sold the 3D Printed results as a vendor in a steampunk environment IRL.

0,5512,Mashrabiya Bracer,"This design is abstracted from traditional Mashrabiya, an architectural screen designed to separate the Harim in the Middle East (men and women's quarters).  Just as it acts as an environmental (protecting from intense sun while providing free air movement) and cultural barrier and shield, the bracer embeds intricate design details that can only be achieved through 3D printing.  The design, based on a 3D scan of the artist and parametrically mapped to the body contours, suggests the extension of cultural place into the fashion of the individual and seeks to explore how culture can update as technologies evolve and the cultures become more global >>> How does one celebrate their culture and heritage in this newly globalize world?

This has been a project I have been working on since I first got my printer. I wanted to develop something that could not be manufactured by any other process other than 3D Printing. I also wanted to make sure that the design was possible to print without the help of supports, as I have found that do not have the patience to deal with them. The most challenging piece to design was definitely the Knight, but I am quite happy with how they all turned out!
The pieces are quite large, so I suggest printing at ~75% scale for most boards. I printed my pieces on a Makerfarm 8"" Prusa i3v in PLA @ 0.2mm layer height. Each piece took a while but it was definitely worth the effort. Enjoy!",8036,BigBadBison

0,5555,Sintron MK8 Extruder Z-Sensor and Cooling Fan bracket,"A combination of two objects, a z-sensor mount bracket for an 18 mm capacitive or inductive sensor and a 40 mm cooling fan shroud to direct cool air onto the print.  These are for use with a Sintron Prusa i3 MK8 Extruder, but could easily be modified to fit other printers.
The instructions for hooking up the sensor are typically on the side of the sensor itself or in its data sheet. Also be aware that sensors like this come in two flavors PNP and NPN. An overview of what I used also be found here: http://www.instructables.com/id/Enable-Auto-Leveling-for-your-3D-Printer-Marlin-Fi/
Also it depends I suppose on which controller electronics you use.
For a Ramps 1.4, which is what my printer has:
the sensor circuit will probably need the power wire hooked up directly to 12 VDC, rather than the z-axis minimum endstop connector.
the second wire pair containing ground and the wire from the transistor 2n2222, will need to go to the z-axis minimum endstop connector ground and signal input.
Regarding the second fan (and in my case the extruder cooling fan) - it is controlled via the Fan output on the Ramps 1.4 which is D9. D9 is controlled using the G-Code M106/M107 commands in the Marlin or Repetier firmware. This would not be the case if you are using a second extruder heater.
I'm actually not sure how to the hookup in case of a second extruder and its heater. Potentially I guess a person could use 12VDC relays or high power SCRs to turn on both of the extruder heaters together using the D10 output.
One other note of warning, I recently modified this mount to move the sensor to be behind the x-carriage and thus be closer to the center of travel for the x-y plane. Otherwise the sensor winds up hanging over open space when the heat bed was homed on the y-axis, That meant I had to be super careful about the homing order and could never to a HOME ALL command a second time if the sensor was not over the heat bed.
To deal with the above problem of homing, I just posted the new z-axis proximity sensor mount for attaching using screws (two spaced horizontally at 25mm apart) to the back of the x-carriage. Its not a perfect solution either. But it does provide a safer homing order using XYZ instead of XZY.",13573,Scott Lewis

0,5633,Taj Mahal - the jewel of Muslim art in India,"The Taj Mahal from Persian and Arabic, ""crown of palaces"", pronounced [ˈt̪aːdʒ mɛˈɦɛl]) is a white marble mausoleum located on the southern bank of Yamuna River in the Indian city of Agra.
It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his favorite wife of three, Mumtaz Mahal.
Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643 but work continued on other phases of the project for an additional ten years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million Indian rupees ($ 501,000 US) which in 2015 would be valued at around 52.8 billion Indian rupees ($827 million US). The construction project employed around 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahauri. The domed marble tomb is part of an integrated complex consisting of gardens and two red-sandstone buildings surrounded by a crenellated wall on three sides.
The Taj Mahal is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and is widely recognized as ""the jewel of Muslim art in India"". It is one of the world’s most celebrated structures and a symbol of India’s rich history. Designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983, the Taj Mahal attracts some 3 million visitors a year.",443,alienkim

0,5670,Extending Gripper Toy (Kinda parametric),Derivative of a toy. Challenges the idea that nostalgia must be bought back from corporations... I've tried to make this file parametric.

0,5675,Parametric Boardgame,"This design is derivative of the game battleship and challenges the notion that board games need a single designer. This is an Open Source parametric game design. The rules change based on the number of players, the desired complexity (depth), and the board shape. I encourage people to come up with their own rules to play and their own Celestial Bodies and Power cards (just be fair). I would also love it if someone could help me model some of the stuff I need to finish the game. (I need connecting and stacking mounts, all of the Celestial Bodies, and artwork for the cards) You use different color 3mm bits of filament as markers and as the pegs found on the bottom of the Celestial Bodies themselves. (The bodies will also have holes in them) The board is generated via parametric script so it can be increased or decreased in size to fine tune your game. I will try to add tabs to it so that we can build non-symmetrical game spaces lego style. The hopeful goal, is to see this game played at hackerspaces and conventions all over. If people like the idea maybe we can start an official League.

0,5677,Arm Mounted Launcher/Pepper Spray/Flame Thrower,This device is derivative of the Hadouken from Street Fighter. It allows a person to have the video game power of throwing fireballs. It challenges the idea of letting reality rule your life... THE USE OF THIS DEVICE MAY RESULT IN A DARWIN AWARD USE AT YOUR OWN RISK I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY INJURY OR DAMAGE RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DEVICE IN FACT I DON'T RECOMMEND YOU EVEN USE IT... MOVE ALONG NOTHING TO SEE HERE http://s2.photobucket.com/albums/y44/LinkReincarnate/?action=viewÂ¤t=video-2010-11-10-17-27-20.mp4 Derivative of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4674 Thanks to Sublime for his original Pencil launcher design. This can be strapped to your arm to fire small projectiles or trigger aerosol cans. It is small enough to fit inside of a sleeve. I also remade the firing latch to require more force to trigger. It fires via pullstring. Ideally you would tie the string to a 3d printed ring to place on your finger for triggering. This would ensure that you had to move your hand out of the projectiles path in order to trigger the device. Ie if this is mounted on the bottom of your wrist you would have to pull you wrist back and away from the gun to shoot it ala spider-man. If it's mounted on top of your wrist you would drop your hand away from the gun to fire it.Always use the safety pin from the original pencil launcher to lock the launcher when not planning a shot. MRK 2 Barrel Features Glueless assembly and a reinforced trigger post. Thanks again to sublime for cleaning those latches up for me. MRK 2 Piston features an extended handle for better grip on the safety. MRK 3 Piston features thicker arms for stronger rubber bands and better alignment.,14694,Gamer (LinkReincarnate)
0,5678,Retractible Cord Or RubberBand Battery,A simple pull string mechanism powered via rubber band. The spool posts are a bit long so someone could put a gear on it and use this to power a clockwork contraption or pull string toy. (If you don't need the extra lenth just clip them to size) Or you could use it as a retractable key leash {or lighter leash combined with my bic lighter holster) Also makes a great powered wheel. Just omit the string and wedge the rubber band between the two shells after pulling it through the center spool. Attach the wheel by the posts of the spool and the shell will turn freely around the spool. A good use for this would be maybe a pull car.,14694,Gamer (LinkReincarnate)

0,5682,Handy Bits,"I love my Leatherman Tool, always fixing and getting so much done with it. But to carry the large bit sheathes around has always been awkward. That's where Handy Bits come to the rescue. This design idea came from a similar design from Bartimaeus and his Bit Bracelet. I liked this idea but didn't want to have to buy nuts and bolts, but wait I can 3D print just about anything and I figured I could design his bit bracelet to work without the need of support or nuts and bolts. And that's what this design is a single print rotating hex bit key-chain free of support or post print processing! ",957,mtnbiker

The posture was carefully made for a result that can be printed easily without any supports, any glue and in one piece on any FDM printers . The robe was modeled from a night Silk dress, so it's like a body glove with some plys (ok..lots of plys in this case ;) ). I tried to add a bit of mood in her gaze with the hair that hide half of her face. the beauty in her simpliest state... I hope you will enjoy this figurine as it's an easy print on any decent FDM printer .(the pictures are from a standard solidoodle4 with 0.4mm nozzle, nothing special ) As usual with my models, it's free , and you can do what you want with the model , no restrictions ( apart the attribution of the source)

Note : The model is in two parts : the bust and the half star.
you need to print 2 x 'half star' and glue them together, then you can put the star in the hands of the bust (advice : glue it in final position too, but it can stay in the hands without glue..)
my example of the star was printed with a transparent ABS filalement.

0,5740,S.brooch,"The S.brooch takes inspiration from Netherlands’ close historic relation with wind power and windmills. From cutting wood and building a naval empire to pumping water and gaining land from the ocean, Dutch engineering and innovation have found clever solutions to national challenges throughout the country’s rich history. Today, Dutch design offers exactly this, simple, clever and often witty solutions to daily problems. The brooch mimics a rotating windmill represented by a Fermat’s spiral, also known as a parabolic spiral. What makes this spiral so aesthetically pleasing is that the angle of succession between rotations approaches the golden ratio. But the main reason for using the spiral isn’t an aesthetic one, by sliding a piece of clothing under its centre and rotating it, the brooch is able to cleverly stay in place without the need of a pin. It can be used as a jacket’s lapel pin, to hold a tie in place or just as an accessory. The S.brooch is simple and elegant enough to be a unisex item, but better yet, it is a conversation piece that could lead to a historic lesson or discussion of what Dutch design and innovation have deeply engrained in its culture and history, and could offer to the United States and the World.",12857,Trede

0,5751,The Flapper,"I've started sculpting base meshes which are fairly generic and can be used a a framework for future models. This shouldn't result in my work looking ""samey"" (well, I hope not) but it will save some time. For this entry, I shall focus on human faces' which unless very deformed (or have non-human elements added), follow a basic rule of proportion. I decided to start with a female head, neck and partial shoulders (what is also known as a bust) as there is a very complicated model I want to make in the future and I'd like to get practised with as many components as I can in advance. The theme I chose for this model is the Flapper. Here is a poem I found which describes the idea fairly well: The New Fashioned Girl Let them sing of the girls of the long, long ago, Who were shocked if their elbows or stockings did show, But I'll chant of the maidens whose ankles are free, To show their half-socks and the shape of their knees, Let them praise those back numbers who turned in their toes And panted and fainted when MEN would propose; Compared to the short-haired, bob-headed fry Who meet all proposals with right to the eye. Let them shed all their tears in a crocodile pour For the simple simp sister who flourished in yore But I'll cast my vote in the way that I feel - For the girl self reliant, bright, snappy and REAL --Unknown You can read about this in my blog: http://www.southquay3d.com/index.php?route=news/article&news_id=17"" This model when fully assembled is 14cm tall.

0,5752,Aria the Dragon,"This was a really difficult model to build and keep support-free. I wanted to see if I could make a delicate and ""Pern-like"" dragon  and I built Aria in Blender, whilst keeping the support-free directive. I also decided to rig her so I could experiment with poses and re-use the model if I wanted to. I should warn you that using rigged models isn't a case of ""just pose and print"" - any high resolution sculpting will have to be completed after the pose is baked (I believe is the term) into the geometry. The temptation is to put your model into an elaborate pose but you will quickly find that the original idea is unprintable and you really have to work the angles to keep the look. I wanted to keep her crouching like a lizard would, rather than the Adalinda model which is sitting flat on the ground. However, to keep her support free, I had to keep her looking up - which I think gives her a gentle appearance. I found this excellent dragon rigging and modelling tutorial series on Blender Cookie: http://cgcookie.com/blender/cgc-courses/creating-... 
It is by David Ward and it's free (yay!) and very useful but it doesn't cover 3D printing considerations (I was on my own there). Aria is my first rigged model and there is no way I would have progressed without the guidance from David's tutorial.

0,5753,Scarab Beetle Box (with secret lock),"The scarab beetle is a small model with a secret compartment which is accessed by pulling back a ""drawer"" and opening up the beetle's wing case.

For more information, visit this excellent page
http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/erev/hd_erev.htm...
It is worth researching this style as it is beautiful and striking. To the ancient Egyptians, the scarab beetle was symbolic of the sun (Ra) moving across the sky every day (the beetle rolling a ball of dung was seen to represent this). My model has a stylized beetle with a winged Ra between his two front feet. The model consists of 12 parts which must be fitted together. All pieces print without support.

Aware that they very much resemble decorations so favoured at that time of year, a Pumpkin Gree will happily make its temporary home in a well-tended garden, unnoticed amongst the seasonal paraphernalia. Unfortunately, any Trick or Treaters who visit a home with a resident Pumpkin Gree will quickly find the joke is on them, as these creatures have great appetite for all sweet things and very little conscience about how they obtain them. Children who complain that their treats have been stolen by a small growling pumpkin will be labelled by their parents as UNTRUTHFUL and GREEDY. The Pumpkin Gree finds this very funny indeed. Of course, should a child ""accidently"" drop some candy nearby; the Pumpkin Gree will let them pass. They may be little monsters but they do like intelligent children.""

Odile is commonly known as the Black Swan, but of course, you can print her any colour that you like. There is a lack of 3D printable swans and definitely those that can be printed without supports - so I made one. Full size she is about 8cm high but scales well. The small dark blue Odile was printed using a beta LittleRP resin printer (http://www.littlerp.com/) with MakerJuice (http://www.makerjuice.com/) For scale, the little Odile is sitting on a US quarter and is next to a British 10 pence piece.

Many thanks to Anoroc for letting me know and for using her for his demonstration:-) ""Once a century, Adalinda flies to the top of the highest mountain in the realm and sings for her love who died so long ago"" I am sure dragons can sing. Here is Adalinda, a female dragon whose song is the most haunting of all. I've had it on my mind for a while to build a dragon, but I wanted to make one that didn't require supports or assembly and here she is. Tolkien style Dragons are not generally shaped to avoid overhang, so the design took some experimentation and thought as I didn't want to compromise too much with shapes. You will need to use lots of cooling when printing her with PLA. With ABS, an enclosed environment is preferred as too much cooling will cause the model to crack I have built her with an open mouth and hollow throat because I wanted her to really look as though she is singing, so don't be surprised at the partial hollow when printing.

This is part of an experiment for myself to show that Blender can be used for models that require some precision work. The threads were built in OpenSCAD using the library by aubenc(http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8796), but the assembly and design was done in Blender alone,importing the threads when needed.

0,5765,Tessellating Flower Coaster Reloaded,"This is a re-design of my tesselating flower coaster. Whilst I had originally been happy to use filament swap as a means to change colours, I found this method to be unpredictable when changing from PLA to ABS (the ABS petals ocassionally failing to adhere) and the flowers are limited to one colour only. A re-think was in order and I decided an inlay method would be the best way to go. Not only would it give me the freedom to have as many different coloured petals as I would like, there was the challenge of creating two models which must fit together and appear seamless. I used this software to design the tessellation with: http://www.peda.com/tess/",15320,Louise Driggers
0,5766,Tessellating flower coaster,"I wanted a side project to iron out a few techniques for a larger project I am working on. Some time ago I went through a tessellation fad and I made quite a few designs but never had any idea what to do with them - until I discovered 3D printing:-). I dug up a flower design I'd made and set about turning it into a 3D model. Not only is the flower seasonal (and in theory, it's spring time in the UK),but I wanted new coasters for my study and the flower seemed a shape that would lend itself well to being contained in a circle. I have included the following files: 1) A single flower with petal detail 2) A flower coaster 3) A single flower without petal detail (in case anyone just wants the basic shape) If you want to use the coaster on any surface considered delicate, then I recommend you attach an additional base to it and test first. I also suggest you test how well your filament of choice can handle heat if you want to put hot cup of tea or coffee on it. The single flowers if printed out in sufficient quantity and variation of colours, can make pretty toys/trinkets.

0,5776,the American Craftsman Bungalow Birdhouse,"Presenting the American Craftsman Bungalow Birdhouse!
This birdhouse features two entrances, upper ventilation through the chimney and windows as well as sloped drains in the base to allow fluid to run out. There are multiple interior platforms built in to the corners so birds can snuggle in places where wind is unable to blow across them. Along with the veranda, there are also three perches for birds to hang out on.
There are two hefty center-aligned screw slots for tree mounting and for extra stability, there are two decorative support trusses so keep it from going anywhere!
This classy casa is designed to print without the use of support material. Even the body prints as a single piece! The base, which includes the porch for the veranda, slides in from the front and comes to a rest with the columns mating with the beam of the roof.
I strongly recommend printing in PLA on a printer with a build platform at least 220 mm long and 150 mm wide. Also there are bridges on this model! My original Replicator can handle them just fine so most printers should. They are around and inch long at their longest.
This can of course be proportionately scaled, however it was designed to best accommodate small birds like finches, blue-jays, chickadees and the like.",15395,Mr. MegaTronic
0,5777,"NiQ, The 3D-Printable Action Figure - by 3DKitbash.com","NiQ, the 3D-printable action figure, is articulated and pose-able and stands 11.5"" (292 mm) tall. He prints in thirty parts that snap together using 3DKitbash's 3D-printable pin system. He's designed to print support-free and no glue is needed.
NiQ has these articulated features: head, shoulders, chest, hips, elbows, knees, and ankles.
NiQ’s head is designed for insertion of either pre-manufactured 8 mm doll eyes or beads (not included) or 3D-printable eyes (3D model of eyes included).  You can customize NiQ with 3D-printable accessories that are coming soon on www.3DKitbash.com.

0,5778,Cutting Thread Hobbed Bolt tool V2,"Hobbed Bolt which teeth are cut from the threaded part of the M8 screw have even better grip than tapped one (you can't stop the filament with you fingers). Given that, here it is the hobbing tool. It uses a Dremel drill with a cutting disk of 0.6 mm and a precise position system with 20 steps. The base holds the drill in its purposely designed Dremel threaded hole.
During my tests with hobbed bolt, I figured out that this kind of hobbed bolts tend to push the filament towards the screw threading direction. My new thread cutting tool has the possibility to rotate the screw in order to achieve the right orientation of the cuts and balance the strength component of the slanting thread. It looks that the right cutting angle is about 5° and it is marked with an arrow on the base. Other marks show 15° and 30°.

Near the climax, when the trees begin to die, kodama can be seen falling from the air and dissolving on the ground.

0,5832,My Neighbor Totoro!,"NOW FREE!
Now you can print you're own Totoro! 
What is Totoro?
He has been called many things from ""a giant furry thing"" to ""a rabbit-like spirit"". Basically, he is a spirit of the forest. Totoro is not a traditional Japanese character: he came completely from Miyazaki's imagination. However, he is obviously a mixture of several animals: tanukis (the Japanese version of raccoons), cats (the pointed ears and the facial expressions), and owls (the chevron markings on their chests and the ""ooo""-ing sound they make with their ocarinas at night).
The name ""Totoro"" comes from Mei mispronouncing (she has a tendency to do so, though it wasn't clear in the dub) the word ""tororu"", which is the Japanese word for ""troll"". When Satsuki asks her ""Totoro? You mean, the Troll in our book?"" she is referring to their book ""Three Mountain Goats"" (The Three Billy Goats Gruff). In the closing credits you can see their mother reading the book to them. Although it's hard to see it on the tape, in the picture book for the movie you can see the picture on the cover shows a goat running over a bridge while a Totoro-like troll looks up from underneath the bridge.

She is the older sister of Princess Anna, and the ruler of Arendelle. Her powers over ice and snow ultimately led her to become the famous Snow Queen. She is voiced by Idina Menzel.
Elsa is loosely based on the titular character of ""The Snow Queen"", a fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen, and to a much lesser extent, Kai from the same story. While the character from the original fairy tale was neutral and, to some degree, villainous, Elsa was rewritten as the deuteragonist.

Make something and tag it as a remix! I've included a stl called ""handcut"" that will make the right size holes for the fingers to grab(don't print it, un-manifold on purpose). Sink it in almost to the bottom of the cylinders and Boolean. Smaller parts and those with not much of a footprint could use help from a brim. For me, these were: Cigar, beam, antennae. All other pieces seem to stand on their own. Some of the objects have numbers after their names. These numbers indicate the amount of each piece you will have to print to make one complete model. If you are painting the piece, you can print multiple eyes for different expressions. The body took the longest to figure out. I made it with small tabs at the top and bottom of the door that will need to be cut through with a blade. I made mine serrated and have included a photo to illustrate. I had different parts of the door fuse due to printer settings. If that happens for you, a little work with the serrated blade will open it up. After the door is cut all around, gently pry it open to work the hinges loose. Clean up around the armholes and tabs on the inside with a blade so the tabs are able to be pressed and moved slightly. To assemble the shoulders, press one tab(there are 2) and insert the shoulder into the socket at the same time. The ridges in front and back both need to be set completely into the ring on the shoulder. This will allow the shoulder to rotate with a little tension. Attach 4 links to one shoulder to make an arm. The link2 pieces are the first ones to attach to the bottom of the body for legs as they are angled slightly. Attach 5 links to this to form one leg. If the links don't fit together with a little push, run a blade around the inside hole of the link to loosen it up. Links and hands can be printed with a high infill number to make them tougher. The foot has a hole in the bottom that will fit rare earth magnets if you want to glue one in.",15553,simon kangiser

The gods reigning over their classical pantheon were born from her union with Uranus (the sky), while the sea-gods were born from her union with Pontus (the sea). Her equivalent in the Roman pantheon was Terra.

Once poured into the cup, sugar is put around the opening and soaked with grappa, then fire is set, in order to burn it dark and sticky. Then the cup is closed with the top, that will stick to the body of the cup. Each friend drinks from a different nozzle, and the cup shall be passed around and never touch the table unless it is empty. The top is decorated with an edelweiss, as it is tradition :) Pouring hot coffee mixed with alcohol in a plastic printed cup is NOT a good idea.

The idea combines 3D constructions toys with 2D puzzle games in one set. They can be used to build different 2D shapes with various colored pieces, as in puzzle games. But not only this, they can also be fixed together from all sides to build 3 dimensional structures, similar to construction toys.

0,6281,Mk.V (Okapi) A.M.V.P. fictional armored vehicle,"This is the A.M.V.P. Mk.V (code name Okapi).  This is the latest in the A.M.V.P. family of vehicles including the A.M.V.P Mk III Chinchilla; it has been redesigned to offer a support free print and a snap-together fit, eliminating the need for glue.  I designed it in Tinkercad and printed it using PLA plastic on a Makerbot 5th generation. Printer settings were as follows: temperature 275 degrees, extruder speed 90 mm per second,  infill 10%, layer height 0.2 mm. I used 2 shells.  To assemble the main body of the vehicle, use the flat H-shaped clip  to secure the two hull halves together tightly. The axles twist-lock into the wheels, and the long clips snap to the bottom of the hull securing the wheels and axles: the clips will only fit in one direction following the shape of the hull. The large turret is secured to the back of the vehicle using the rod with a hatch on the end: when the small square extrusion on the hatch is oriented to the side (either direction) the rod will fit through the top of the turret and the hull. To lock the turret in place, rotate the hatch, orienting the extrusion towards the back of the vehicle. To complete assembly of the main turret, push the barrel or extra gun mount into the space at the front of the turret (I found it easiest to point the barrel straight up and push down.)  To assemble the smaller, secondary turret, fit the small T-shaped pin through the base of the turret with the large flat end facing upward, then fit the small gun into the turret slot.  To secure the secondary turret to the front of the vehicle, fit the pin into the provided hole (turret will be oriented sideways to the vehicle) then turn the hull assembly forward to secure. Though the design is intended to for assembly straight off the printer bed, with lower resolution printing, some filing and sanding may facilitate better articulation of moving parts. Features include snap-together assembly, rolling wheels, rotating turrets, multiple elevating gun mounts and secondary turret options available in print. I hope that you enjoy playing with this newest model as much as I have!",10241,ben.creager

Elsa is loosely based on the titular character of ""The Snow Queen"", a fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen, and to a much lesser extent, Kai from the same story. While the character from the original fairy tale was neutral and, to some degree, villainous, Elsa was rewritten as the deuteragonist.

0,6302,Froggy: the 3D printed ball-jointed frog doll,"Here is my first ball-jointed doll. I have always been fascinated by these but shocked at the prices they command. When the excellent Sonia Verdu uploaded her beautiful Robotica, it inspired me to make my own doll for 3D printing. Whilst Froggy is not a derivation of any of her work, I should give Sonia credit, because if I hadn't had her work to refer to, it would have taken much longer to design this frog.
I made a prototype of Froggy back in February and took two prints to MRRF, where he generally got a positive response. After MRRF, I went to stay with my cousin and his family in Chicago for a few days, where my two ""nieces"" gave me detailed feedback on what they would change.
I returned home and left Froggy alone whilst I worked on other projects but I eventually returned to him and decided to add in the following features:
1) People will try to pose a doll like a human if it looks even slightly human. The original froggy was designed to move like a frog, so I humanised his proportions and movements. He can sit up and stand by himself. His head twists and is angled like a person's.
2) My mum suggested movable eyes, so I thought I'd see if I could do this. Hooray! I could.
3) He has jointed and posable fingers. Sometimes I just like making things difficult for myself:-)
He isn't the easiest model to print and assemble, but I really enjoyed making him.

Plex Tiles consist of a triangular tile and a snap on connector. Once the connector snaps on, they are very difficult to get off, so you don't have to worry about your designs falling apart. Just plan it out, because you may not get them apart again. The base tile has 3 holes and it prints at 2"" (50.8mm). Connect them together to form the main body of the garment. Use the 2 hole tiles for finished edges, like the top of your bag. The strap tile can be used for straps, belts, bracelets, etc. The 3 way connector allows you to drape designs off your main piece or form more complex shapes. It's really up to you.

0,6388,One-piece Ormerod bed support.,"The MDF bed provided with the Ormerod is too floppy and is better replaced with an aluminium one. The problem is the complex cut-outs required (usually laser cut) to fit this on the bed support means that normal people cannot cut this. Therefore I have produced a one-piece bed support with a flat top enabling you to use any bed you wish with only simple drilling which can be more easily done at home. You can even use this support with the original MDF bed if you like by drilling 3 mount holes as shown in the photos and it does support the floppy MDF better. I have done this as I found my aluminium bed too heavy so I am drilling chunks out of it to reduce weight. By making a the bed a single piece I have reduced manufacture time, increased rigidity, eliminated beam/back alignment problems and eliminated connecting screws.",16522,VynZ

It's shown being printed on a PRINTinZ printer plate in ABS. The part looks like it's on a raft, but that is just support structure for the curved surface. It stayed stuck to the plate through the whole print and came right off when I flexed the plate after printing. Most of the support circles are 1/2"" thick, the large middle circle is .25"" thick and the tiny circle in the middle is 1/8"" thick.

I had a few friends request them and I wanted something that would print quicker so I cut some meat out of it. But it's as sturdy as the other one. This one is printed with 3DPrinterNinja.com PLA in Black and Fluorescent Orange.

Here is a tool that let's you emboss images on to your 3D printed Easter Eggs. Use your own images or find them on the web. It includes ImageToData.exe (for PC) a tool to convert images into a format that can then be used by the enclosed OpenSCAD script to emboss the eggs. You can also emboss spheroids and blimps by adjusting the parameters, or use the code for your own designs. NOTE: There are a lot of sample image maps in the .zip file. QUESTION: How hard is this to use? ANSWER: It is not hard.. You have to edit settings inside of a text file inside of the OpenSCAD envirioment. You don't need to know OpenSCAD programming!

0,6546,Swirling Water Unit - Vortex water nozzle - Vortex Process Techn,"DUE TO AN ALLEGED PATENT BREACH THE STL-FILES ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE, check out http://www.watreco.com/
3D printed nozzle with magnets, creating Vortex water, to restructure the water molecules and thus vitalizing the water? Is it actually working? I don't know but there´s lots of info out there claiming so. I designed this nozzle to raise the awareness for our urgent need for pure water on this planet. If this design works... great fun! If you start thinking about how you can contribute in some way... OUTSTANDING :-)
The information collected here is for educational and entertainment purposes only. It is not to be considered medical advice, prescriptive or diagnostic. See your physician for qualified health care. And I do not claim that this design will work in any special way. I was inspired by the work of many great inventors and researchers like for instance: 
Viktor Schauberger https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Schauberger & Johann Grander https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Schauberger
Why did all this get my attention? Well lots of people claim that the water structure is very important. Like for instance: http://www.fractalfield.com/implodermagneticresearch/LukaszImploderResults.jpg http://stud.epsilon.slu.se/5243/1/vagnell_m_130130.pdf http://www.life-sources.com/pdf/lsi_magnetized.pdf
I also included some interesting youtube videos below. 
So I designed this vortex nozzle to be 3D printed... Now anyone can download, 3D print and test if the alleged benefits of ""living water"" are true or not... (if this design is working that is...) Made 1/2 inch + 3/4 inch threaded parts so that you can use most adapters and hose connectors (for instance 1/2""-M22x1 for the tap). 
Versions with holes can be used for rods/M6 rods as tripod stands in ponds/barrels etc. Alternatively threaded pipes etc can hold the unit directly. 
Also possible to add magnets to test restructuring of the water. Perhaps water ""remembers"" toxins etc and acts like it still is in the water even if filtered out by carbon filters etc. Imagine what that does to the drinking water that circulates back to the tap from the sewers. Magnets might restructure (reset) the ""water molecule clusters"" since the H2O molecule has a negative and a positive side. Lots of people are doing research and it looks like the industry successfully uses water treatment that suggests that it´s a fact... (I will test these magnets: http://www.magnordic.se/shop/gummi-magneter-17x9-... )

0,6547,Floating floor drain cover,"170mm diam, 20mm thick design/logo cover for floor drains This lid floats if water enters the drain, normally it will prevent the water trap from drying out to fast... And it looks nicer than the original Also added a blank cover for you to add your own logo (stl + step) I designed the floor drain cover to be printed with my own conductive ETPU rubber ( http://rubber3dprinting.com/ ) because it results in: • An exclusive look with its matte carbon black surface finish. • A nice print with a minimum of stringy cobwebs (the TPU and carbon black mix makes for a favorable rheology and retraction settings can be optimized). • A cover that will not crack/break when stepped on. • Less energy used when printing since it does not need a heated bed (like ABS etc). To prevent the cover from compressing too much under the foot I made some internal ribs, that way the infill (20%) can still be low and the final part will do a great job as a float. I used a 0.7mm nozzle at 230 deg C for this print. To use a bigger nozzle than the commonly used 0.4mm gives the 3D print so many pros, for instance lower pressure in the melted material -> higher speed. The biggest advantage is the much stronger parts due to the better bonding between the layers (also makes it more likely to be water tight). The conductivity is sometimes a main feature for using the ETPU but in this case the surface finish and ease of 3D printing were the main drivers (the fact that conductivity is not a drawback in this case helped of course).

0,6604,Scissor Snake Family,"The Scissor Snake Family
WINNER Second Runner-Up Support-free Product Design Christmas 2014
The ""Scissor Snake"" is a fun 3D printed toy. It is easy to print without support; the ""Scissor Snake"" comes off the build plate assembled and ready to use. Its motion is incredibly smooth, resulting in a very precise, fast, durable and fun remote grabber.
This design uses an exclusive, supportless crossover bearing, engineered for the project. The cross-over bearing interlocks with the frame when fully extended under load, causing the frame to become rigid, thereby reducing stress on the bearing pivots. This results in a strong and durable toy cable of lifting many times its own weight. Kid tested. Guaranteed to provide many hours of fun for kids of all ages.
Buy a 3D printed Scissor Snake here.
Other members of the Scissor Snake Family
Mini - Use as a test print to calibrate your cross over bearing for no fusing and tight motion
Scissor - The Classic scissor snake, easy to print and a good size for kids
Super - Once you have it dialed in, this one can be a lot of fun; it little more challenging to print
Magnum a.k.a. the Trouser Snake - The longest scissor snake in the familiy
Curvy (Experimental, needs tweaking) - Forms an ""S"" curve when extended
Corner (Experimental, needs tweaking) - Forms a curve when extended, to snake around a corner
Instructions
Print at 100% scale, using 30% to 50% infill, no support, at 0.2mm layer height. The ""Scissor Snake"" is designed to print at 100% scale on wide range of 3D printers. However, if the print comes out looser than you'd like, you can reduce the scale by 5 to 10%; this will produce tighter joints. If the print come out too tight, increase the scale by 5 to 10%; this will produce looser joints. Normally this is not necessary. Otherwise, for best results, don't change the scale of the model.

0,6695,Robohand Finger-sensor,"Got inspiration from all the different 3D printed prosthetic hands and was thinking my conductive TPU rubberlike filament could add a dimension or 2... This dualstrusion will create the finished finger with joints and a force sensitive fingertip. The fingertip has a outer shell that, when pressed, will connect to the inner conductive surface, thus creating a closed circuit. This model is only a quick proof of principle design... and the picture of a full hand is only a visualization of a hand that could be printed in one go... perhaps!? Are you up for the challenge? The smudging of the conductive material resulted in a closed loop at aprox 8.5k and when pressing the tip it goes down to 7.2k Its my first dualstrusion, I used 0.7mm nozzles and I could for sure need to adjust the height of the nozzles and it would be great to have retractable nozzles to get rid of the smudging... I designed the finger in a straight shape but it would be better to print it bent outwards, the TPU material has a problem to bend the finger all the way back after it has been closed lots of times... or change the shape of the joints... 3D printed with ABS and with this conductive TPU material: http://www.creativetools.se/pi-etpu-95-250-carbon-black-1kg-se http://rubber3dprinting.com/ http://www.palmiga.com Follow on Instagram and twitter: http://instagram.com/rubber3dprinting https://twitter.com/rubber3dprint http://youtu.be/5Bmg8tpI6Lk http://youtu.be/_7pgMqtvkug https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9NCSGdXK8U",17574,Thomas Palm

0,6723,Party Popper Cannon / BB Gun,"This beauty is a deadly little design that takes regular party poppers and turns them into ferocious firepower. It works by inserting a stripped down party popper into the back of the barrel of the cannon and loading a BB bullet into the front. When you pull the party popper string it sends the BB flying at incredible speeds and distances (~ 15 metres).
To prepare a party popper for use all that needs to be done is to remove the contents of a party popper excluding the popper string and charge.

0,6785,Slider Puzzle. 3x3.,"The classic 3x3 slider puzzle to test your skills and patience. As you can see in the photo I suck at puzzles and cant get the last two numbers. Hopefully you can.
Print the frame and the number blocks. I have included a normal and mirrored versions because for some reason my printer printed the normal as mirrored and vise versa so you will have to see which one your printer will do correctly. Just print one of the number blocks and see how it comes out then use the appropriate files. After cleaning up the print slide the blocks into the frame and push the end frame on. look under the two frame pieces and you will see a small divot at one corner. Make sure these are together when pushing the end on. Check that the blocks slide freely. If not make sure all the support is removed from the corners and under the tabs. Smoothing the block sides with some fine sandpaper helps as well. If the end frame does not fit tight enough put a drop of superglue on the tabs. Print at 0.1 layers, 3 perimeters and 50% infill. Set support for everywhere for best print. Be careful removing support from the blocks so you dont break the edges. I used 3.5mm spacing and 1 interface layer and it came apart ok. Use a different color filament for the blocks and highlight the numbers with a felt pen. Scramble the numbers then try to arrange them in order from left to right. Good Luck.",14881,mybrainhurts

0,6839,TAZ hexagon Hotend 40mm Fan Mount,"Update 5/31/15 This is the final version. My machine has been happily printing for a full week with zero issues. Update 5/24/15 With feedback I made the open end of the funnel section larger so it covers the bottom part of the heat sync. Have mine up and running today, so far so good but have not pushed it yet. The original fan is only 0.57cfm while the new one is 4.83cfm, big difference. I have seen the problems people have with heat creep since the TAZ printer started using the Hex hotend. It's caused by that tiny fan not being able to keep it properly cooled for long prints. So I decided I would tackle the issue by making my own mount. Now, I have a TAZ 4 with the Hexagon Hotend upgrade and that is what I designed this for. I am not 100% sure it will fit on the TAZ 5 but I think it will. This did take 8 hours of design and around 5 prints to get it right. I don't have my fan yet (should be here tomorrow) but I am fairly confident this will work properly. I wanted to stick with the 5v fan since the wiring is already there. I also wanted to find the best fan I could get that would not be noisy and would last a long time. I did a lot of searching and decided there was one great choice, a Noctua NF-A4x10 5v fan, this brand came highly recommended by some high end computer builders, they called it ugly since it's brown and off white but that is the signature of Noctura and they are not from China but Austria I got my for $14.89 off Amazon. The fan shroud fits around the cooling fins by friction but also has a single bolt mount using the existing hotend bolt. Please let me know if this works on the TAZ 5 or TAZ Mini is you decide to use it. Remember this is a work in progress, this might end up being the final design but I won't know until I have fully tested it.",15527,Terry Morris

0,6843,Garmin sandbag GPS mount to GoPro mount conversion,So I had one of these Garmin dash sand bag mounts for a 12 year old GPS that I never use and I decided to convert it to a GoPro mount. The Garmin units have a non skip rubber on the back and 4 pouches with some kind of weighted material that makes the mount excellent for non permanent mounts. Here in California it's illegal to mount anything directly to the windshield like the suction cup mounts.,15527,Terry Morris
0,6844,Long sliding top box for case cracking tools 170mm x 56mm x 20mm,Needed a box for my new case opening (cracking) tools. Boxes I found here were too short and I never designed a sliding top box myself so I figured it was time to try and first rendition worked perfect. No support needed. Lid has an indent on one end to make it easy to open.,15527,Terry Morris
0,6845,Simple DVD Wall Hanger,Just print solid (may need a wide brim to stick) and then use the 2 screw holes to mount to wall. Holds DVD's with or without protective slip covers (some have a cardboard slipcover that may be collectable). Also holds console games. Print is 252mm long so be sure your printer can print it. It might fit smaller printers if turned 45 degrees,15527,Terry Morris
0,6846,Hoodie string toggle,"I got so frustrated when my hoodie strings pulled out for the umpteenth time. It seems they do it no matter how many knots I tie in them. So I created these ends. After some searching I found they are called toggles. Pull your string though, tie a knot. It's that simple. My hoodie has the wide flat string but I think these will work for most as it has a 6mm hole.",15527,Terry Morris
0,6847,Pringles Can Straw Dispenser (for big printers),"Good straw dispensers are expensive and most break easily. So I decided to make one out of a Pringles can. The main bar is a good 245mm long so you will need a large prints, it may fit your printer if you turn it 45 degrees. I printed on a TAZ 4 with ABS and used Acetone to glue up all the parts.",15527,Terry Morris
0,6848,Kokopelli native american statue,Printed as 2 pieces for ease of printing then simply acetone together (or glue if PLA).,15527,Terry Morris
0,6849,Jumbo Glue Stick Mount for TAZ or others with 20mm extruded fram,So I now use the purple Elmers glue stick for my print bed and I bought these jumbo ones (takes less time to apply). This mount is a simple press fit into the slot on the extrusion (it's nice and tight on mine). Just clip a few glue sticks to it so you don't have to look for them each time.,15527,Terry Morris
0,6850,Dremel 36 Bit Holder Grid.,"I have a lot of Dremel bits (1/8"" shaft) and I was trying to find a better mobile storage method. I got a plastic toolbox and I printed this matrix to hold the bits white the rest of the stuff goes in the top of the tool box. Magnets will be inserted to hold the bits from falling out when (not if) the box gets tipped over. Holds 36 bits.",15527,Terry Morris
0,6851,52mm filter adapter for GoPro Hero 3 (for bare lens),This adapter allows you to use any standard 52mm filter on your GoPro Hero 3 lens (without the waterproof case). It simply presses on the lens (snug fit but I would not use it for extreme sports as it might come loose) and screw in your favorite 52mm filter. The filter I have shown on mine is a blue filter but probably most popular would be a polarized filter.,15527,Terry Morris
0,6852,TAZ 4 LED Magnetic Strip Mount,"Just got my TAZ 4 printer and while I desperately want LED lights like I had on my old printer (makes viewing printing much easier and clearer) I did not want to start modifying my machine just yet (under warranty and all). So I took advantage of the modular mount they designed for the extruder. It has 4 bolts (see photo) that made a perfect place to slap some magnets on. Also the LED strip I happened to have was 24v (same as the system) and so I am hooking it up in place of the fan. I print mostly ABS so I removed the fan, if I ever print PLA I can just remove the LED's and put the fan back on in a minute or two.",15527,Terry Morris
0,6853,Cookie Fork,"No mess cookie dipping fork. Simply push the fork into the creak of the cookie and dunk in milk. Then simply eat of the end of the fork and repeat until box of cookies is empty.
**Pinshape disclaimer: Please ensure your printed object is safe for contact with food**",15527,Terry Morris
0,6854,My Latest GoPro Tripod Mount,"I make a lot of GoPro mounts and accessories and this is my latest tripod mount. It's been updated for maximum strength with wider yet perfectly fitting fingers. The mount has an inset for the GoPro bolt to seat perfectly. The bottom requires a 1/4-20 nut to be epoxied in place, it's also good to epoxy an acorn nut in place for the GoPro bolt. Print this solid for best strength. No support is needed for most printers, you may need minor cleanup of the holes.",15527,Terry Morris
0,6855,Circular Card Holder,I took the original and flip it to the proper orientation for printing and I removed the initials in the center. This is the 1.5mm slot version that prints very well with filament printers since the smaller gaps may have closed up on these printers. The original can be found here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:130119,15527,Terry Morris
0,6856,Gun Cylinder Pen / Pencil Holder,Based on a novelty sold by Think Geek. Looks like an oversized revolver cylinder but it is a pen holder.,15527,Terry Morris
0,6857,"""Do Not Lose"" key fob",Made this for my dad's shop where they keep losing small keys for towel dispensers and such. The red was just painted with a paint pen.,15527,Terry Morris
0,6858,GoPro handle,"This is 2 parts to make printing easier. I make a lot of GoPro mounts but I was never 100% happy with them, too tight, too loose, holes too small.... So I completely redesigned this one and I may be updating my other models with this connector. Also, I found something important for printing thin walled items like the GoPro mounts (fingers), it's important to only have 2 perimeters and then 100% infill. I use to print with 4 perimeters but it turns out that is way too weak because of layer adhesion. See this thread for the full story http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?262,357700",15527,Terry Morris
0,6859,GoPro Coolant Line Mount,"This is for the end of 1/4"" ID Loc-Line Any-Which-Way Coolant Hose. It makes for a great clamp mount for GoPro cameras.",15527,Terry Morris
0,6860,Large Label Peeler,"I put this as a derivative even though I made it from scratch, I made it because I liked the Ultimaker idea but I needed for much wider labels (some of my labels are up to 80mm wide) and I felt it did not need to be as deep and such as theirs, I also added a ledge on the back for clamping it to the table with a spring clamp, you could also drill a few holes and bolt it down. I use a Primera LX400 label printer and make several sizes of product labels on a regular basis. This unit will work with up to 88mm wide labels. I kept printing in mind and it will print without support. My printer did it with near zero cleanup, only a 2 tiny strings from the bridge that were easily removed. P.S. this thing shows errors that Netfabb won't fix but Slic3r had no problem slicing it so any slicer should be OK 2/9/2015 Added 12cm wide version by request.",15527,Terry Morris
0,6861,Just a grid of hexagons,"Made this because I was bored and thought it would look cool, it does.",15527,Terry Morris
0,6862,Another SD card holder,Wanted to make some to fit a drawer I have. Needed to leave them leaned over a tad to fit. Each holds 6 SD cards,15527,Terry Morris
0,6863,Brother PT P700 Label printer label catch tray,"So I just got this printer and I am going to print a lot of short labels, I found that if I was not vigilant they would fall out into my pile -o- crap on the floor and be lost forever. So I designed this little catch tray to catch not only the labels but the little scraps that it cuts.",15527,Terry Morris
0,6864,Paint Pen stand,A simple round stand for DecoColor Acrylic Paint Pens. Holds up to 9 pens.,15527,Terry Morris
0,6865,Hole Size test print,"Most slicers make holes smaller than the actual design for various reasons. This is a chart you can print so you can test fit items before designing the proper holes for it. I made it only 2.5mm thick as there is no need to go thicker like some other test prints I found. Also I don't skip sizes like some others (I.E. 10, 12, 14). This is only round but I may do a square one as well latter. The holes are in 1mm increments from 1mm to 25mm.",15527,Terry Morris
0,6866,Wall Vase,The original was on it's side and a bit complex so I re-made it from scratch in an orientation that will print with no support and sized it to fit in my printer (just under 100mm long). The the same basic shape as the original so I will post it as a remix but it's modeled from scratch.,15527,Terry Morris
0,6867,Rubber foot installation tool,"So I make a product that has a case and these rubber feet that go into holes in the bottom. The feet fit very snug and must be pushed and turned to fully seat them, you can do it by hand but after a few it hurts your fingers so I designed this tool to make it much easier. It's a handle and plate that has a pointed texture to grip the rubber feet. I am sure there may be other uses for it. Tenderize a steak, smash a bug... I don't know... Maybe post your ideas of a good use",15527,Terry Morris
0,6868,BAZINGA! Big Bang Theory,Catch phrase of Dr. Sheldon Cooper on Big Bang Theory TV show in a keychain format.,15527,Terry Morris
0,6869,Wavy Pendant Bezel Tray,This is a pendant tray designed to add your favorite items into then fill with clear epoxy resin.,15527,Terry Morris
0,6870,Mini screwdriver set holder,This is not simply a gravity mount with oversized holes but rather a press on holder that holds the shafts of these screwdrivers with friction so they won't fall out when it's thrown into a drawer. It's made very specifically for this Craftsman set of jewelers screwdrivers that can be found here: http://www.sears.com/craftsman-6-pc-screwdriver-set-jewelers/p-00941106000P?prdNo=33&blockNo=33&blockType=G33,15527,Terry Morris
0,6871,Star Trek Coaster,"Simple drink coaster with the iconic Star Trek communicator symbol in the center. I made this one slightly larger than my last as I want it to fit my 1 liter bottles of soda. OK, I added a stackable version but you will need support printing it. It's just go an inset in the bottom that allows it to lock into the top of another one.",15527,Terry Morris
0,6872,High Tech Chopsticks with ring to hold them together.,Running out of ideas for things to design I saw some titanium chopsticks similar to these (not exactly the same) and I decided to make my own design. I each sushi a lot so they will come in handy. While designing them I decided they would fit together with bottoms facing each other so I also created a ring you slide on them to hold them together for easy storage and carrying.,15527,Terry Morris
0,6873,Remote Caddy,"In my bedroom my remotes were always getting moved around, lost and more. I wanted to make a caddy that would be strong and durable but use minimal material so this is what I came up with.",15527,Terry Morris
0,6874,"Simple hanging spinner, can be used for hanging basket for loose",This is based on nopheads Sky Hook http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:85 I printed it but first could not get the hook into the bearing and it needed support. So I decided to make my own that could be used inline rather than bolted to the ceiling.,15527,Terry Morris
0,6875,GoPro knob long,I have been asked many times to release this so I finally decided to. It's a GoPro knob replacement for the original long one. You will need to provide the bolt.,15527,Terry Morris
0,6876,Apple Ear Bud Shirt Clip,"If you are like me you need something like this. When I go walking with my ear buds on every time I turn my head one pulls out. For a short time I used a big paper clip to clip it to my shirt but that was a pain to put on and take off. So I designed this device loosely based on a flat plastic paper clip I have seen before. It's easy to put on and remove, it fits the ""Y"" connection on all Apple ear buds perfectly and is low profile, you can barely tell you have it on. And best of all, no more ear buds getting ripped out of my ears when I turn my head.",15527,Terry Morris
0,6877,Nut capture for 8-32 nuts,"Made these for a box I am making, it's time consuming to get the nut hole just right and not many SAE ones here so I thought I would share. The nut squeezes in easy but not so easy that it will fall out.",15527,Terry Morris
0,6878,Lasko mini heater hanger,"So I have a cover for my printer that I made to keep the heat in (to prevent cracking on taller prints). But it turns out that even with the heated bed and print head it was not hot enough. So I got one of these little Lasko electric heaters from Walmart (online not in store). It was cheap (like $15) and it has a fan and no tilt switch (safety for turning over). This is made to fit on a desk at work. So my cover is made of plane old schedule 40 PVC pipe. I tried the heater by clamping the cord to the top and pointing it down towards the build platform and it works great. It gets plenty hot inside now but not so hot as to be dangerous. So I made this hanger so I could quickly attach it and even point it. Print solid (or close, I used 80% infill) and then drill and bolt to the back corner of the Lasko. The holes in the mount match up perfectly with the space between the fins.",15527,Terry Morris
0,6879,Solder Spool holder,Simple design to hold a standard 1lb spool of solder. Glue 5 standard BB's in the divots provided to allow smooth unspooling of the solder. Works without them as well but a bit nicer with them. Print solid as you want it strong.,15527,Terry Morris
0,6880,Small LED Flashlight clip mount,So I am kind of a nut for LED flashlights. I have and have had many over the years. Right now my favorite everyday flashlights are these little 3watt units that take 2 regular AA batteries. Many makes of them but they all have a 3W Cree LED and are 90% the same. Anyway my biggest issue is if you lay them on their side they roll around and off tables. If you sit them straight upright they are easily knocked over. I finally had enough and made this very simple clip mount. The flashlight is easily pushed in and yet snaps in securely. I used only 1 screw to attach as I thought maybe turning it would be handy.,15527,Terry Morris
0,6881,Art Deco Pendant,"It's a little big, but big is in.",15527,Terry Morris
0,6882,GoPro Zip Tie mount 2,So I made a zip tie mount here http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:83689 And I decided to remake it from scratch. This one is open where the zip ties cross and like the other one can be held down by 2 zip ties in either orientation. I think this one is better.,15527,Terry Morris
0,6883,GoPro Hero3 minimal case,"Inspired by http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:76082 This one does not have the top latch that tended to break easy, it also has the side with plug ins fully accessible even the micro SD card can be removed. The case is very tight and has 2 bump rods to assure the camera does not fall out. Printed with .25 layer height, 4 perimeters 50% infill",15527,Terry Morris
0,6884,GoPro Hero single axis gimbal,"So I use a 6' pole to get elevated shots. Problem is the mount is rigid and so the camera angle changes with the angle of the pole. Solution, a single axis free floating gimbal. I printed with 50% infill and 4 perimeters. The pivot point is made for a 8/32 bolt and nut (I use them all day and I don't have any metric). Either leave the nut loose (suggest a lock nut) or do what I did and glue the screws to the inside of the frame, it will not come apart this way unless you pull on the frame wall.",15527,Terry Morris
0,6885,GoPro Tripod mount,My own design of a tripod mount for a GoPro camera. Has a hex hole in the bottom for a 1/4-20 nut and space above that for the bolt. I printed with 50% infill to make it strong and 4 perimeters to reinforce holes.,15527,Terry Morris
0,6886,GoPro Camera 3 point suction cup mount. Hood mount,"I want to be able to put my GoPro Hero on the hood of my car so I can video without seeing my dash, dirty windshield & hood. I just bought my $300 camera and just don't trust their $30 suction mount for this. So I bought 3 RAM suction cups (super strong and reliable) and created a triangle plate to mount them as one. This way, up to 2 can fail and I won't lose my camera. I would feel safe with this rig driving cross country at freeway speeds. On my first version I made the mount in the center and low. Turns out it was impossible to attach the knob and the mount was always visible in the lens. I did use a few extensions to make it work but I knew I could do better. So my second version (this one) addresses this by raising the mount up off the triangle and placing it at the edge. It works great.",15527,Terry Morris
0,6887,GoPro Hero3 lens cover,Just a lens cover for the GoPro Hero3 series camera. Just for preventing damage to lens when not in use.,15527,Terry Morris
0,6888,Drawer Label Holder,"I made these for my Akro-Mils plastic drawers but they may work with others. This is simply a holder so you can drop a paper in it displaying what's in the drawers. I have well over 120 drawers with jewelry supplies and adding more all the time so I wanted an easy way to add a quick tag. Print on a paper strip that is 2"" x 7/8"" and it will slide right in. Now these drawers are made of HDPE and is near impossible to glue to. So I use a clear (red liner) double sided tape called VHB (Very High Bond) Acrylic adhesive. It's similar to the tape used to put rubber or plastic moulding on the side of cars (as well as car make emblems).",15527,Terry Morris
0,6889,Skull,Description,15527,Terry Morris
0,6890,Eye Glasses Shirt clip,"I was always dropping my glasses when hooked in the neck of my shirt. This thing will prevent this. You need a large ""fender"" washer and 2 small strong magnets. I built in support for the middle bridge as I did not like the support that was generated in Slic3r.",15527,Terry Morris
0,6891,Anti Splatter paper bowl cover,"When heating up soup or canned meals in the microwave I always covered them with a paper towel to prevent splatter (covering the inside of the microwave with bits of food). The problem is that many times the paper towel dips down into the food soaking it up and making a mess. So I designed this to solve the issue. It covers the paper bowls while still allowing hot steam to escape. If the food splatters, just rinse it off in water.",15527,Terry Morris
0,6892,4 leaf clover,Wanted to make a clover necklace for my cousin. Rather than just making it flat faced I made it with the center inset to it's framed. After printing I decided to fill the middle with doming epoxy (that's what I sell for a living) and I think it looked pretty good. It will look good without the epoxy as well. Could also be used as a keychain.,15527,Terry Morris
0,6893,Chili's pendant for necklace,"My second cousin works for Chili's so I thought I would maker her a pendant (actually her moms idea). I did put filler on it, sanded it and painted it so it's smoother in my photo than it prints.",15527,Terry Morris
0,6894,Klingon Bat'Leth,"I could not find one here so I made one. Klingon Bat'Leth right out of Star Trek. Update I really wanted a smooth surface. Well I sell doming epoxy for a living for doming name badges, jewelry and promotional items. I decided to dome the Bat'leth, it looks killer with the clear dome and the silky smooth surface but you can still see the print marks so I also did one with silver paint. Now it looks more like the real thing (only much smaller). Still need to get some leather lacing to make the grips. New photos added with the epoxy and paint.",15527,Terry Morris
0,6895,Babybel Cheese holder,"I am a fan of these small puck shaped cheese disks so I decided to print a stacking holder for them. These cheeses come in a pack of 6 so I made this tall enough for that. My printer was not tall enough to print it in one shot so I divided it into 2 pieces that can easily be glued together. I originally designed it to hold them with the cellophane in place but after I made it I found my next batch of cheese would not fit as well, there were variations on the cellophane wrapper. So instead just remove the cellophane and put the bits in with just their wax shell on.",15527,Terry Morris
0,6896,LED mod for AirWolf 3D printer **Budaschnozzle,Ring light mount for AirWolf 3D printer. should also work with others that have a 50mm hole spacing for the Budaschnozzle.,15527,Terry Morris
0,6897,Micro Mesh Sanding Pad Storage Rack,"Micro Mesh pads are high precision double sided flexible foam sanding pads. These are used for model making, headlight restoration, guitar restoration, Polymer clay and much more. I have been using them to sand my printed Star Trek badges. I decided I needed a storage container to keep them organized so I built this one. If you want some of these unique pads you can get them at http://epoxyjewelry.com/misc.html",15527,Terry Morris
0,6898,Car Cup Holder Adapter,"My car's cup holder was made for very large cups only and has open sides meaning anything smaller (fast food cups, bottled water...) just falls over when taking a turn. The inner walls are slightly tapered in to form fit fast food cups. So I designed this adapter. Works great with all but large drinks which work OK without the adapter. Since it has walls all around even smaller items can't tip over. Could also be used to hold keys, change or a cell phone.",15527,Terry Morris

Leaving all files attached so you can mix and match what you may want to use Testing with solid blocks, hollow blocks where you can see through and also ones where the letter is only slightly indented into the front. Update: Settled on hollow blocks with the letter embossed in on the front, this seems to be the easiest to print without support and minimal material. Just print one of each letter (and two 'S') in the picture I scaled things up to 1.2(120%) as they were a bit small. Then print out the roof's. The one with the chimney can be printed 'flat' as the pitch is 45 degrees it shouldn't need support. Will post picture once set is printed",18306,Pierce Ferriter

0,6923,Simple Spool Holder,This spool holder prints in one piece and it fits the bed in the design orientation. As designed it should fit most spools (up to 92mm wide and 200mm diameter) but just in case you need to modify it I have included the OpenSCAD source as well. You need need a M3 22mm screw to mount it (you will use it instead of one of the M3 16mm screws).,18347,mgx

0,6929,Ninja Feet for Printrbot Simple Metal,My Printrbot Metal Simple used to wander aimlessly around the desk. The desk also acted as a resonance box. So I designed these little feet/shoes/pads and printed in Ninjaflex and ever since then it stays put and is quieter.,18347,mgx
0,6930,Z-stabilizer for Printrbot Simple Metal,If your Z axis oscillates/vibrates you can use this little bracket to fix it. It is designed to travel freely along the z axis (before using please test and make sure it doesn't lock/bind on the screw or on the rods).,18347,mgx
0,6931,Printrbot Cable Straps,"Printrbot Metal Simple is a great little printer, but it has this small issue where one of the cables occasionally gets tangled in prints. So I spent maybe two minutes in 3D Builder to design a ring that slides on the Z axis and pulls the cable up with a rubber band. People in the office saw it and started asking for the design, even suggested I upload it to Thingiverse. I refused uploading such a trivial thing but, later on, I had people coming back asking for rubber bands. Yes, apparently there is a shortage of rubber bands in the world ?! Now that is a problem worth solving, so I set to design a version for Ninjaflex (yes, amongst 3D printing folks Ninjaflex might be more common than rubber bands). In order to print this version on the Metal simple you need the Adafruit adapter (337267) and for the Microsoft Slicer you will need to edit the settings here: C:/Windows/System32/spooldrivers/x64/3/PB_3DPrinterDeviceConfig.xml (yes, there is a built-in slicer coming with the Printrbot Driver in Windows 8.1 and can be tweaked quite a bit). Ok, I'll admit the Ninjaflex is not that easy to print, so I figured I should also try a PLAin PLA version. That turned out equally functional and maybe better looking than the other two. Enjoy!",18347,mgx
0,6932,Square Extrusion Clamp,"This clamp joins OpenBeam/Misumi 1515 extrusions at a 90 degree angle. It is meant for axial and radial loads, it will probably not do a good job for angular loads. Additional parts needed:",18347,mgx
0,6933,Semi-automatic Bed Level Probe,"This is a simple, micro-switch based bed level probe that costs less than $1 to make and gets the job done, reliably. Is is semi-automatic, in the sense that you attach it to the extruder, run the calibration routine (G29 in Marlin or G32 in Repetier) and then remove the probe. That means it does not add any weight to the print head, a nice plus for Delta or Bowden based printers. As long as you don't bump the printer or change the bed plate, the re-calibration is not needed. It was designed to be quick-mount: it slides right on the effector plate on Kossel (8mm thick one) and it takes only a few seconds to mount on other plates that are 8mm or less. The jaw is adjustable and tightens for increased repeatability. In terms of height it should work for any hot-end that is less than 65mm in total height from wherever the probe attaches, which means both the j-head and the longer clones will fit just fine. In terms of accuracy: I get a 20 micron repeatability but I can't say how much of that is because of the printer vs the probe vs the switch, the bottom line is all of those combined are less than 20 microns which is more than sufficient for most prints. NOTE: If you are discouraged by manual probes and still waiting for that fully automatic sensor you might be surprised to how much of a difference this little thing can make: consider this will at least allow you to get the printer in a shape where it can actually print parts for a more complex probe. This should be lot more precise than the Kossel original allen key probe and more reliable than the newer FSR solution (at least for the time being) in the sense that it allows you to have a heated bed as well as a super-tight bed plate (safe removal of stubborn prints). The large version is compatible with both 1/2"" (small) and 20mm (large) micro-switches. Additional parts needed: Note: Height maps generated with Repetier (Tools->Bed height map) and Excel.",18347,mgx

0,6937,Tree Top mount,"Turns out putting the tree top (Christmas Tree Star) is a real problem these days. Our first tree top mount cracked. Bought a second tree top, this one did not come with a mount at all. The third one came with a mount that was way too big and stood out. Interestingly enough all these tree tops attach with a 5/16"" (8mm) rod, so here comes this little adapter: at one end it has an 8mm hole where the tree top goes. The hole is slightly tapered to make up for variations in the rod diameter as well as tighten well when you press the top in. At the other end it has another conical hole - from 8mm (5/16"") to 15mm (9/16"") diameter, this end goes on the tree. There is also a cut here to give it a bit of elasticity.",18347,mgx

0,6945,Poly Pencil Holder,"So after I got my printer, I figured I'd make stuff for the desk at my new job. I made a few basic shaped pencil holders at first, which you could find at my thingiverse page, and then I decided to spice it up with this design. The modeling of all my pencil holders are pretty simply, just a repeated spiral pattern. I noticed how cool this looked when experimenting with different spiral cross sections when starting the model. I'd consider this the 2nd stage of designs so maybe I'll have a better one later...
I'd recommend printing at about .25-.3 layer height, concentric layers, lower range of temps, and lower speed to reduce the stringiness cause if it's stringy then you have to removed the strings in the holes. I tried using a lighter to remove the strings, but beware that it can burn the print color.

My goals when starting was to create a different design than what we usually see for 3D printed quads and enclose all electronics in the design itself. The idea was an experiment to create parts from a strong material with thin walls and low infill to keep the weight down. Everything is designed to fit the electronics from a DJI 450 Flamewheel. As you may have noticed i call this a ""Alpha"" verion and that is becasue it´s simply not finished. While all parts do fit together there are things missing in the design. Hopefully someone can get something out of this project, maybe use parts of the design or it can spark ideas for new projects.

0,7103,3D Printed (Sun) Glasses for Children,"This design is developed for 3D printing glasses/sun glasses for children (sizing approx.: 42 – 14.5 – 109 – 25). Note, the design can be scaled and reoriented for adult head sizes, which is featured in the images (if this is done, the lenses should be repositioned in the frames to ensure a fit). This design is meant to act as a contribution to making and donate to a global need. It is free for all and is meant to be utilized in developed and developing countries where 3D printing might enable the production of items that enhance the daily lives of many. This is meant to push the agenda for democratizing design and suggests/encourages designers to contribute beyond their own needs and desires.
Included in the design are the frames and the lenses. Each will need to be 3D printed to enable the manufacturing of functioning glasses (either prescription or not). The design is noted as sun glasses since the proper fitting of glasses with prescription lenses requires expertise outside of the designer’s skills. 3D print the lenses and these can be taken to any lens manufacturer, scanned and reproduced via CNC in actual lens material. If these services are not ready available, the 3D printed lenses can be sent to someone with that capacity, however prescription fitting puts the focal point of lenses in specific locations, be aware of that.
Please be cognizant of materials used in the making of glasses. Since these come in contact with the skin, ABS is an inappropriate material for functioning use since it’s composite anatomy are known toxins.
Design for good. Happy making. ",14744,dustin_headley

0,7112,OpenRailway EMD SW1500 1:32 Locomotive,"The EMD SW 1500 is a American diesel switcher locomotive made by General Motors' Electro-Motive Division during the 60's and 70's. Some 800 were made and there are several still in serivce in the United States. 
This 1:32 scale version of the EMD SW 1500 locomotive is part of ""The OpenRailway Project"" which is a Open Source initiative to bring more free model trains to the world. While having done several different 3Dprinting projects in the past i needed something with a little more attention to detail to 3Dprint. Since me and my dad had already built a garden railway (scale 1:32) it felt like a good idea to go for a train. I went to a model train store in Stockholm to discuss what train that might be suitable and after two or three cups of coffee i decided on the EMD SW1500. 
Design work began by searching for specifications, drawings and pictures. While i didn't have very much luck finding the kind of drawings I initially hoped for (I did find a few) I had to rely heavily on different photos hence some details may be incorrect. Everything is 3D-printed but the handrail which is made from 1.5mm Aluminium welding rod. The are some details that need attention but basically you can print and assemble everything if you want to own your very own 1:32 SW1500.

DESCRIPTION 
CLICK HERE & READ THE MANUAL BEFORE PRINTING 
I designed the hand using ABS plastic the more infill the stronger the hand but the longer the print time. The entire hand will take approximately 18 hours in total and cost about $8.00 in plastic (at 4 cents a gram). All parts were printed on my Up Plus 2 with 14cm x 15cm x 15cm build volume. There are also a lot of metal screws that you need to hold all of the printed parts together. I used sheet metal self tapper pan screws 8G x 9mm.

0,7132,Modified prusa i3 x-carriage with Laser support,"See a full description of the project on Sway: https://sway.com/LqQa1e8HWW4ZqbUk I added a J Tech 2.8 Watt Laser Diode to a Sintron Prusa I3. You may find that mounting the Laser 100 MM above the print bed does not allow as fine a laser as you would like. Optimal is 30 MM, but I wanted to mount the Laser higher and allow both laser and 3D printer to work potentially in conjunction. I planned on moving the level sensor to the back of the x-carriage to be more centrally located in the x-y plane to measure the z-axis limit. I have designed a new sensor mount for that purpose which is also attached. Also note that moving the Z-position sensor to the back of the carriage can limit the Z- movement by some amount - depending on your your printer's frame. In my case that was about 15 MM of Z travel that I lost from the top end. It could also affect X-axis travel, again depending on your printer's frame. Last added picture shows laser cut gear made on 1/8 inch thick Bassword. This took 4 passes at the 2 AMP setting at 50% speed and 1 pass at full speed.",13573,Scott Lewis

0,7135,MGN-12H Carriage Loader,This retainer saves time and eliminates frustration when mounting Hiwin MGN-12C/MGN-12H carriages back onto the linear rails. These 12mm linear rails are typically used in Kossel based printers and although the carriages have a wire retainer it does not do a good job in preventing the balls from escaping. Note: The no-name carriages vary wildly in dimensions (I found a difference of almost 0.5mm between two carriages in the same set) so you might have to scale before print. This part is designed to have 9.25mm clearance between the retainer wires.,18347,mgx
0,7136,MOAB - MOther of All fan Brackets,"An easy way to generate brackets to attach any fan to any PCB board. A list of pre-defined brackets included. The script was initially meant to generate fan brackets for the RAMPS board but I decided to make it fully customizable: it now allows you to create brackets that take fans of any size, snap onto PCB of any size, can have any height, but probably best of all features is that you can generate both mini-brackets (2 holes) as well as full brackets (4 holes, fully enclosed on two sides), to balance between saving plastic vs. rigidity and improved air flow. While this was meant for PCBs, feel free to experiment it could probably be used for many other scenarios, for example to attach a fan to a NEMA17 motor or to space two PCBs by attaching brackets back to back, etc. UPDATE : It can now generate PCB supports with no holes (example scenario: Raspberry Pi or Intel Galileo feet). Specific changes:",18347,mgx
0,7137,Simple 60mm fan bracket for RAMPS,"Note: This is deprecated, see http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:166045 intead UPDATE: v2 version (pictured in gray) is slightly taller: 27mm clearance to PCB.

0,7139,Battery Adapter: AA to C,"The adapter allows you to use an AA (LR6) battery instead of a C (LR14) battery.

0,7142,Alien Jungle,"A set of alien flora designed for our 18mm scale Wayfarer miniatures (same models we use for Pocket-Tactics).

0,7163,Lightbulb Mesh Lampshade,"I was almost about to throw out an old Ikea lamp when I realised I could give it a new life with the help of 3D printing. This is a simple design that gives personality to the light, and casts some nice shadows as well. The inside diameter is 34mm so just make sure your lightbulb and socket will suit - although of course you can always just scale the print up or down to suit!

0,7164,Replacement Arms for Sunglasses,"My Aviators never quite fit properly behind my ears, so this is my solution for a more comfortable fit. You can easily make your own for any type of wireframe glasses or sunnies (best for wire arms with a diameter of 1.5mm, although you could scale the print or simply drill the holes out to fit your frames).
Simply cut the arms off, leaving 15mm of length to slot into the holes of the new 3D printed arms. I used Araldite to glue them into place. Make sure you try them on before gluing, you want to get a good angle on the arms so that they wrap around your head behind your ear.

0,7165,Hex Phone Sound Amplifier,"A clean and simple amplifier for your mobile phone.

A modified version of this won the i.Materialise 3D Printed Wood Challenge (http://i.materialise.com/blog/entry/announcing-five-winners-of-our-3d-printed-wood-challenge)
Check the dimensions of your phone against the slot dimensions pictured - I designed this for smaller phones like my old Samsung Galaxy S2, so you may want to scale up the design prior to printing if you're using a giant phone. Read more about the design of this product on my blog, including the multi-coloured effect created by swapping filament colours during printing. https://edditiveblog.wordpress.com/category/phone... Enjoy!",19460,edditive
0,7166,Beer Bottle Lock,"Firstly let me state this is not an original idea – recently a Beer Bottle Lock made the rounds on 3D printing news sites, stemming from an Instructables tutorial by JON-A-TRON (see http://www.instructables.com/id/Beer-Bottle-Lock/... for the original).
However with Xmas fast approaching I wanted to design one for a bit of fun with my family. Simply print the 2 pieces out and use any small travel lock to secure that final beer (whether it's yours or someone else's!). Unlike the original by JON-A-TRON this design requires no screw. The dimensions are quite loose so that it should securely fit a wide variety of bottle shapes, if you don’t need this flexibility you might like to thicken 1 or 2 areas on the inside prior to printing. Sure it could be snapped off, but this design is really just for a bit of fun - if you're genuinely worried about people stealing beer maybe you need to reconsider who your mates are ;) Follow how this was designed on my blog https://edditiveblog.wordpress.com/category/beer-...",19460,edditive

Either way, take your karting to the next level! You can read about my process designing and creating this design on my blog https://edditiveblog.wordpress.com/category/mario...

This is not just a test piece, but I now use these 3D printed fins on my board. I've been printing them on an 'Up! Plus 2' printer using the 0.15mm layer settings and solid fill for strength. I have also been using a small amount of acetone just to finish off the outside surfaces, but the quality off the 'Up! Plus 2' has been pretty good so you don't necessarily have to do this.

The whole design is designed to be fastened together at the ends with threaded rods through all of the parts. The parts are currently designed at a very small scale so that you can scale it up to any size that you need. The file ""keyboard6.stl"" is an exploded view with all of the parts, and is only for an overview of the design, not for printing. Note: A lot of folks were having trouble with non-manifold geometry in the original version, so I used a tool to repair all of the files. This might lead to some of the screw holes being strange, but I think it will probably print correctly now.",19499,SoftEgg

0,7329,Pokeball (opens and closes),"UPDATE 08/26/2015 - I made this file ""public"" on Onshape. So if you want to edit it or add new stuff to it you can. Just go to https://cad.onshape.com/signin and make a free account. Then search ""Pokeball by SpragClutch"" in the public area.
UPDATED TO VERSION 2 ON 06/13/2015 
This is a workable Pokeball that opens and closes. It is 3"" in diameter. (7.62 cm) Made it for my nephew. Enjoy! 
This is version 2 (""V2"" in file name). I have printed and made version 2. It is good to go. 
Version 1 is no longer available. But if you happen to have Version 1 (""V1"" in file name), these are known issues, 
1.75 filament fits snug/tight in hinge. On the plus side, once its in it makes a nice solid hinge. I increased the size of the hinge hole in version 2.
""Outer shells"" needs to be manually aligned. And although super glue will work to glue it to the ""main frame"", a thicker glue is preferred. I add alignment slots to the ""Outer shell"" and the ""main frame"" in version 2.
If you run into any other problems or want something else included, please let me know in the comments.

He utilizes a radio encryption decipher backpack to boost his capabilities and it converts into a microwave cannon to fry enemy circuits.

0,7432,My BB Filled LM8UU Type Bearings,"These bearings take 4.5 mm steel BBs. (Copper might work, but I have heard that they may cause problems due to the metal differences.) I printed these on a Printrbot Simple in PLA at .25 layer height and 10% Infill. (I have also tried to print these on a Makerbot Replicator 2 at the Low Resolution with 10% infill, but they had a much lower tolerance. Ie, they turned out very tight and it took a long time to wear the BBs in to their races before smooth travel was possible.) Dimensions: Short: 23 mm High, 22 mm Outer Diameter Long: 48 mm High, 22 mm Outer Diameter Inner holes are 8 mm in diameter. (This should work on 5/16” rods as well.) After printing you may want to use an Exacto knife or 8 mm drill to make certain the hole will give clearance for the rod as the plastic tends to swell into it a bit when printed.) The Combined Version is the same size as the Short with the addition of parts to allow it to be used on a Prusa i3 Rework Y Bed. When assembling the combined version I suggest placing the BBs in the races, placing the top and bottom on a flat surface and then using a clamp to press them together. (Attempting to twist them together may result in breaking the mounting brackets.) The Short uses 16 BBs. The Long uses 32 BBs. I really liked the concept of using BBs for the bearings like in http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:28905, but my attempts to print them out failed. I tried to use Netfabb Basic to repair the file, but still was ending up with 739 flipped triangles. So I began to design this version instead. One of the things I was hoping to do is be able to create a design that could allow me to modify in order to create odd sized linear bearings. Tearing apart inkjets and laser printers I have found many of the rods are 5, 7 and 9 mm sizes which are not typical linear bearing sizes.

Check out https://skfb.ly/F7Lv for a more controllable look of the city, you can even go first person and pretend you are flying a puddle jumper around! Video here
AtlantisCity is how I decided to put it together however I have included the city's base and buildings as separate STL's so you can make your own layout! Each of the buildings has a different look from each side so you can re-use them just by rotating them and it will look like a different building. If you come up with your own building please message me :) 
The rules I used when designing them are: It has all been designed with my FABtotum in mind so wall thickness's and overhangs are right for me but may not be for your printer. The main thing will be the wall thickness's, they are multiples of 0.4mm to go with my 0.35mm extruder. 
I would recommend printing the base and building separately then glueing the buildings on as you see fit, it will make the final product cleaner. I have also included the base as 7 seperate files so it can be produced on smaller printers.
I know the curved building is upside down, just how I made it :p

0,7569,3D-printable generic cabinet knob,"This generic pull-knob for cabinet drawers is easy to 3D-print and mount on any flat surface using a standard and commonly available M4 screw.
The knob can be placed directly on a flat surface or recessed into a 14 mm hole. The cone-shaped recessed version of the knob also allows for glueing instead of screwing.
The bore in this knob is designed to be slightly smaller than 4 mm when 3D-printed, thus making it possible to use a standard M4 screw without needing a nut or tapping the hole it in advance. We recommend you to use as long screws as possible to achieve a strong thread-grip.
We designed this knob as a part of a project where an old pharmacy counter from 1906 was salvaged from becoming scrap. Some knobs where missing and instead of making new ones on a lathe we decided to 3D-print in thick layers using brown PLA filament.

To get the dual color on my single extruder printer I just paused the print and switched the filament. This is in three separate prints (the deck, wheels, trucks and pins) so each part can be what ever color you choose.
Put the pins through the trucks and the wheels and then the trucks piece gets glued on the board (I used crazy glue).
I recommend printing the deck and trucks with supports",20519,timkeeley

It has three pieces that pressure fit together very nicely. The body and the face pieces have an oval so that you can align the parts up evenly when the two pieces are together. The face piece has two tabs to help hold the circuit board in place. It also has pin holes to add your own strap.

The reason I decided to do a Schrödinger's Cat Cube with this filament is because I printed the cat inside the cube hollow and intended to use a white LED to light the cube from the bottom activating the cat and allowing it to glow through the semi-transparent walls which ended up not working like I had envisioned.

0,7600,Akali–the Fist of Shadow,"There exists an ancient order originating in the Ionian Isles dedicated to the preservation of balance. Order, chaos, light, darkness―all things must exist in perfect harmony for such is the way of the universe. This order is known as the Kinkou and it employs a triumvirate of shadow warriors to uphold its causes in the world. Akali is one of these shadow warriors, entrusted with the sacred duty of Pruning the Tree - eliminating those who threaten the equilibrium of Valoran.
A prodigious martial artist, Akali began training with her mother as soon as she could make a fist. Her mother's discipline was relentless and unforgiving, but predicated on the fundamental principle: ""We do that which must be done."" When the Kinkou inducted her into the order at the age of fourteen, she could slice a dangling chain with a chop of her hand. There was no question― she would succeed her mother as the Fist of Shadow. She has had to do much in this role which others might find morally questionable, but to her, it is in service of her mother's inviolable doctrine. She now works with her fellows Shen and Kennen to enforce the balance of Valoran. This hallowed pursuit has unsurprisingly led the triumvirate to the Fields of Justice.

0,7613,Whale Toy,"This big mammal is seriously in trouble.
Whales can live over 150 years, and have a slow reproducing cycle. That makes them very vulnerable to population oscillations or even collapse.
Whaling and overfishing together is an heavy lift and will drown all the ecosystem.
Blue whales, the biggest animal ever existed, have still not recovered from being hunted to the brink of extinction.
I hope this toy will remind how gentle those mammals are, and how much we need to preserve them as much all the ecosystem that keep us alive.

0,7655,The newAhri the Nine-Tailed Fox,"Unlike other foxes that roamed the woods of southern Ionia, Ahri had always felt a strange connection to the magical world around her; a connection that was somehow incomplete. Deep inside, she felt the skin she had been born into was an ill fit for her and dreamt of one day becoming human. Her goal seemed forever out of reach, until she happened upon the wake of a human battle. It was a grisly scene, the land obscured by the forms of wounded and dying soldiers. She felt drawn to one: a robed man encircled by a waning field of magic, his life quickly slipping away. She approached him and something deep inside of her triggered, reaching out to the man in a way she couldn't understand. His life essence poured into her, carried on invisible strands of magic. The sensation was intoxicating and overwhelming. As her reverie faded, she was delighted to discover that she had changed. Her sleek white fur had receded and her body was long and lithe - the shape of the humans who lay scattered about her.
However, though she appeared human, she knew that in truth the transformation was incomplete. A cunning creature, she adapted herself to the customs of human society and used her profound gift of beauty to attract unsuspecting men. She could consume their life essences when they were under the spell of her seductive charms. Feeding on their desires brought her closer to her dream, but as she took more lives, a strange sense of regret began to well within her. She had reservations about actions which never troubled her as a fox. She realized that she could not overcome the pangs of her evolving morality. In search of a solution, Ahri found the Institute of War, home of the most gifted mages on Runeterra. They offered her a chance to attain her humanity without further harm through service in the League of Legends. ''Mercy is a human luxury... and responsibility.'' -- Ahri",19209,董彬文

0,7662,ElastoStraps - Reusable Hook / Loop Fasteners,ElastoStraps are reusable hook / loop fasteners printed in soft PLA. See a video demo at: http://youtu.be/4H6pfnI9fd0 More info at: http://www.nothinglabs.com Just stretch them around two things you want to hold together - and push the mesh over the hooks (don't worry if all the hooks don't catch). I developed ElastoStraps to do things like attach lights to my bicycle. Use Thingiverse Customizer to generate a strap in the size you need - or print one of the provided .STL files. ElastoStraps are surprisingly strong when printed at 100% infill with 1.25mm thickness.,19119,Megasaur
0,7663,Bike Shifter (Friction),"A working 3D printed friction shifter! See video at http://youtu.be/fLMA-8aSsDM While friction shifters don't ""click"" into gear like index shifters - they have advantages. A friction shifter is much more tolerant of minor problems like slightly bent derailers or worn cables / housings. Heavily tested with 7-speed setup - but should work with any number of speeds (front or rear derailer). I just biked from Seattle to Portland using this shifter (204 miles) without any problems. With 300+ miles on same shifter - I'm reasonably confident it's pretty solid and should last a while. poop",19119,Megasaur

0,7667,Low Poly PineApple Planter/Jar,"This low-poly Pineapple can be printed for many purposes and is a fun decoration to have around the house.
It can be printed in one solid piece and used as a decoration, or
The two pieces can be printed separately and used as a container or jar.
Additionally, the bottom piece alone can be printed and used as a planter. A nice leafy green plant can then be used to simulate the leaves of the pineapple.
  This design was inspired by my girlfriend, who has asked me to print her a pot for her cactus. I was originally planning on doing something more traditional, but then I noticed the Low Poly Design Contest and decided that I needed to create something that would be eligible for the contest. She loves Pineapples, and I like the idea of the cactus serving as part of the design itself. Without the proper plant, the design would just look like a simple low-poly planter.    Never having done a low-poly design before and using the completely wrong software for this type of design (SolidWorks), this project ended up being extremely difficult to complete. Almost every surface had to be manually created, and without help of some slightly complicated circular symmetry, this would have been impossible. Once I had the base complete, I decided to expand the project into including the top, so that the base could alternatively be used as a jar.    The bottom should be printed in Yellow/Orange filament. I will be printing mine in PLA at 0.20mm layer height and 60mm/s. The top should be printed in Green filament. Finally, the parts can be dry brushed using Acrylic Paints to add some texture.    Because the top of the spikes tend to be very narrow, I have also uploaded an EZ-print version, where they have been cut off once they reach 1mm thickness, this should allow for an easier print. Make sure you have your retraction and ooze calibrated well before printing this one!",8036,BigBadBison

So here it is the original model for 3D printing.  I've split it into three separate parts so that you can get the maximum build size. It also allows you to print each part with a different filament so that you can get that two colored appearance. Use your filaments to give each print a different color combination.

0,7772,Shattered Faceted Light,"Inspired by a shattered light bulb, this design can be used to fit over an existing light fixture - in my case I wanted to save an old Ikea lamp that worked perfectly well, but the lampshade was old and ugly. Often old products like this are too easy to just throw away, when with a bit of 3D printing it can be re-invented and given a new lease on life.
The smallest inside diameter is 31mm so just make sure you can slide this over your intended light fixture - if not just scale the print up to fit! This particular print was done on an Up! Plus 2, using 0.2mm layer thickness. Very little support material was needed.

structure of the Walkera Runner 250 to make it very rigid against crashes.
With a lower base plate and brackets to reinforce the Frame it is giving the Frame the final strengh.
This also results in a much better flight performance.
By the way a major issue of the Runner 250 is solved, the battery is fixed once and for all.
Simply replace the battery fixing board or glue it to the carbonfiber stock plate for final strenght.
The nacessary washers to be placed inbetween the upper CF Plate and the PDB are included now.
Just break them off the printed Model.
You´ll need 4 pc. 2,5 x 12 mm PT screws to fix it to the upper Frame members.

0,7811,Sequential Stackable Geometric Forms,"Sequential Stackable Geometric Forms
This simple game was inspired in some descriptions made by my girl friend that works with children, some of them with some special needs of attention.
As known, depending on the age of the child and developed program for children, stack with a sequence can be a valuable exercise.
Why geometric? Because it can be usefull to introduce some simple math, such as counting the sides of each piece. Because it is easier to fit.
The geometry may not be the best approach to some young children, but later I will make a non-geometric version.
This game fits to any child in a wide age range.
My goal was to create the sequential stackable game that could be printed easily, at home or in school, in any cheap FDM (FFF) printer.
The chalange was to keep it cheap without loosing the point. So I came with those forms that can be replicated even in wood, that stacks inside of each other.
There are 2 versions of the same game with the slight difference in height of each form. Thus achieves two different fine motor skills levels.

0,7818,CAPTURE,"Product : SD Card Holder
Mainly aimed at photographers, this SD card holder can hold up to 4 SD cards and 2 MicroSD cards.
I call it the 'Capture'. The design goes very well with the photographers as it plays well with the 'aperture' which opens and closes and also keeps the memories safe and is handy and compact.
The uniqueness of this design is that it's a 'one mould design'. If ever this product goes into production, it won't require any other mould to complete the product.
The design has an 'integrated hinge' and a small protrusion for the 'snap fit'. It needs to be produced/made in even numbers as the design itself would complete itself and fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.
It is very intuitive to assemble and even a child can assemble it.
It can be printed using Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) or Polyamide (PA).
When I started designing this, I wanted to come up with a very easy, simplistic and a green design. As there are literally no external components, its very easy to handle and also as it's a 'one mould design' (injection moulding), it cuts down on the excessive emissions, making it greener.
A 3D printed 'Capture' using ABS will cost around 900 to 1000 rupees but if it is mass produced, the cost can come down drastically.
Enjoy the 'Capture' :)
P.S. - The 'Capture' might be loose once assembled as I had to give a minimum spacing of 0.6mm between moving parts, but as my whole design is just one part it was confusing for me to decide which 'part' is moving and where the spacing should be given.
I can send the the perfect fit design too if needed. ",21131,rohit_harip

A geometric fugue celebrating the pyramid shape; also a set of stackable storage trays great for organizing small parts, jewelry and other stray doodads. Includes 5 stackable, reusable pieces.
Print in transparent filament using the supplied instructions to produce a ‘jaw dropping’ piece of functional art. You’ll be proud to say it was 3d printed because it couldn’t be done any other way and looks so good. An excellent subject for conversation, reflection, study and mediation.
Statistics
Total Vertices: 240, Triangles: 448, Edges: 672, or with Quads: Faces: 314, Edges: 538
The minimum thickness of any wall is 1mm with a 0.6mm clearance between moving parts.
The base is 10cm square and covers an area of 100 square cm.  The pyramid is 10 cm in height. There are 100 small pyramids decorating the outside surface, 25 on each side. You won't find the decorations anywhere in the geometry. They are caused purely by the infill pattern and tool path.
Print Instructions
Includes 5 files. For best results, print each file separately in order, with the following settings:
0.1 mm layer, no support. Use a small brim on the first piece only (the file ending in _5).
1 outline/perimeter shell. This is necessary to get the transparent look.
4 top/bottom solid layers. Necessary so floor pattern includes infill and concentric grain.
Interior fill pattern: 3%, rectilinear, infill angle offsets 45% ,-45% (S3D defaults). Necessary to get the small pyramid pattern on the inside.
Interior infill width: 105% - proper width for infill walls.
Exterior fill pattern: concentric. Necessary to get an attractive grain pattern.",17368,richard_swika
0,7826,Cool Pencil Cup,"Similar to my other design. I really wanted to get rid of the overlapping sections so there would be a clear grove on spiral pattern. I edited the other design in Blender and directly changed the mesh, removing and adding faces to get the final result.
I'd recommend printing at about .25-.3 layer height at most, concentric layers, lower range of temps, and lower speed to reduce the stringiness cause if it's stringy then you have to removed the strings in the holes. I tried using a lighter to remove the strings, but beware that it can burn the print color. I used PLA because it doesn't really require extra strength and shouldn't experience high temps.
I would actually like to see it printed at an even higher resolution, but with my printer set up I don't believe I can achieve that. (Well I haven't even tried though...)",18329,Taajwar D'Van Howard

I made this model first back in 2011, as I wanted to learn to use Sculpris, though for the purposes of this contest I have learn as well the low poly technique in a couple of softwares.
The low poly effect gives to this model, in its 3D printed form, a unique charm through the very modern geometrical lines, with a game of shadows and lights on the sharp faces, still leaving the character friendly and recognizable.

0,7836,Blackbird SR71,"I've always been a fan of fighter air crafts and jets. One of my favorite is the Blackbird SR71!
Introduced in '1966' by Lockheed Corporation and Skunk Works to the US, it could fly up to Mach 3+ ( it is three times faster than the speed of sound!) .
Such a design at that time impresses me! It's sleek long body and such a futuristic look makes me fall in love with it again and again. The design just makes you feel that it's flying even when it's not.
Hence I decided to make a scale model of it which could be 3D printed. Designing it was a challenging task as I had to capture all the detailing in such a small model. I had to do the model twice so that I can make it more clean and smooth and aerodynamic as possible.
The whole model consists of 3 parts which include the base, the stand and the main body.
It can be assembled just like a normal scale model which you get in the market. A tight fit binds the whole body together and then it can sit on the your study table or show case grabbing attention from everyone!
It can be printed using Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) or Polyamide (PA).
A 3D printed Blackbird SR71 will cost around 1250 to 1500 rupees.

0,7843,Measure Parts in STL Format with a Digital Ruler,"Sometimes you just want to take a couple dimensions off a part, but you ONLY have access to the STL file. It's difficult to convert an STL file back into a 3D geometric object. (It can be done to some extent but I don't want to purchase and install special software to do a quick and dirty task.) In times like this I've found it useful to load the part in question into your printer host software (Repetier Host for me) and measure it with a 'digital ruler' STL file. The ruler provided has 1/4"" increments, but you can scale it to measure any increment you want. In the example photos I measured the hole spread (3/4"" thank you) on a Printrbot part. Obviously, this method is very limited but it IS free and straightforward. I've also included an STL file of a soda can which can be used as an alternative size reference. UPDATE: You might prefer to use this easy & free program for taking dimensions of STL files: http://www.netfabb.com/basic.php",21832,Michael Graham
0,7844,Easy PCB Vice,Up until now I've been using a drill press vice to hold circuit boards during soldering. The problem is that that type of vice is a hard clamp and won't hold the board well unless you squish it hard enough to risk damaging the board. So I designed a super simple model based on springs that will effectively hold pcbs firm. I thought about adding some more features but decided that simple was best here. Attached is a pdf drawing for those of you who want to make custom jaws.,21832,Michael Graham
0,7845,Harry Potter Inspired Butterbeer Stein,"Keep your drink cold and prevent foes from spiking it with evil potions using this fancy butterbeer stein! After making the stein I couldn't help but add a great hall box to go with it! My printer was simply unable to print out all the little towers on the hall, maybe you can do better. (My wife still loved it!) Our favorite butterbeer recipe is super easy: 3 parts cream soda to 1 part butterscotch liquor, served ice cold.",21832,Michael Graham
0,7846,Extrusion Width Testing of 3D Printed Specimens,I want to share a little experiment I did and see if I can tap the wisdom of the crowd here to better understand the results. I ran mechanical tests on 3D printed specimens with various extrusion widths to determine the effect that it would have on printed part strength. The results were normalized to compensate for the higher strength of heavier parts and enable fair comparison of all specimens tested. This was done by dividing the measured ultimate strength over the mass of the part. The result is the featured graph. I truly expected the graph to have a more predictable pattern than it did. My current assumption is that the Slic3r program's extrusion width function is more complicated than I thought. My conclusion and recommendation for the time being is that leaving the extrusion width at the default setting will maximize part strength. The attached pdf file explains the testing procedure and results in more detail. Let me know what your personal experiences with varying extrusion width have been!,21832,Michael Graham

0,7848,Project Boxes of Various Sizes,"Injection molded project boxes are great for high quality stuff, but 3D printed boxes give you more choices of size and you can print them on demand with the holes you need pre-cut already. For example, if you have a larger printer you can print out the box needed with the holes pre-cut to make the temperature process controller box seen in the main photo. Build instructions for that can be found here: http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Automate-ANY-Temperature-Controlled-Process/ (FYI the box shown in the main photo was NOT 3d printed).",21832,Michael Graham
0,7849,Herb Garden Barrel,"My apartment doesn't have a big enough deck to utilize my full size garden barrel, so I designed a miniature version for herbs. The base of the barrel collects excess water that can be reused to water the garden. The little side pockets are a great way to seperate your different herbs. The pot design is also stack-able if you wanted to do that.

This assembly is a component of the Testrbot open source universal test machine: http://www.instructables.com/id/TestrBot-The-300-Universal-Test-Machine/ I've also provided 'Base Type 2' files if you want to make a higher speed configuration.

0,7852,Prototype Load Testing Machine,This is the prototype printed version of the mechanical load frame I am building. It has been provided as a single assembly just so you can view the model. There is not a set of printable parts because I cannot yet recommend that anyone else build it as shown. I need to figure out how to better adhere steel to abs and how to add the steel plates without doing so much preparation work. The technique of gluing the metal sheets to printed parts is called composite sandwich. You can read more about this specific design and my plan for mechanically testing 3d printed specimens here: http://engineerdog.com/2015/03/26/3d-printing-materials-testing-series-part-1-the-problem-the-plan-and-the-prototype/ EDIT: The final version of this machine can be found here: http://www.instructables.com/id/TestrBot-The-300-Universal-Test-Machine/,21832,Michael Graham

You can read about the project at the link at the bottom, any feedback or fresh ideas will be welcome! . The rectangle is a test specimen specifically designed for a 4 point bend loading on my machine. The part 'should' require 200 lbs to break when printed at 100% infill. . The test fixture design is also included here to reduce the size of later bom's. The fixture is designed so that the load path is 100% steel-to-steel rather than through any plastic, which keeps the frame stiff. . http://engineerdog.com/2015/03/24/introduction-to-3d-printing-materials-testing-series/",21832,Michael Graham
0,7854,3D Honeycomb Infill concept,"A friend and I recognized the limits of current infill patterns and decided to design our own. Knowing that a hexagonal structure uses the least material to create a lattice of cells within a given volume, we let our design take inspiration from the way that bee’s nests intersect two opposing honeycomb layers into each other. This model is, of course, only a concept and is not intended to be used for anything other than looking at. I also added a single comb cell stl file so you can see exactly what the shape removed looked like.

This 3 way phone mount allows me to hang it from the rear view mirror. This phone dock can hold any normal sized smart phone. Attaches to car rear view mirror using the hook. Attaches to any tripod that uses a 1/4-20 thread mount. Attaches to bicycle with zip ties or a hose clamp.,21832,Michael Graham
0,7857,Flexible Spider Shaft Coupler with Hot Glue Spider,"While I think the original Printrbot Z axis shaft coupler is clever, I don't really like it in practice. Mine periodically slipped on the shaft and ruined my prints. As you can see the finished product worked well enough to use on my Printrbot. But it is worth noting that there is no vertical support when you use these, you can just grab the printer's z axis and lift the entire thing straight up any time. So you have to be careful to make sure you don't disturb your printer too much while in use. This design can take a lot of misalignment and it wont slip, but it is also taller than the original Printrbot Z coupler. To be honest if you are willing to part with maybe $20 I would just buy some aluminum bellows, disc type, or slit type flexible couplings because those lock everything in place and you cant accidentally lift the Z axis up.",21832,Michael Graham
0,7858,No Tie Paracord Cam Lock with Hook,"Easy to use, non-slip grip, simple to print. Use this to grip paracord without having to tie a knot. I really like the paracord ratchet (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:23562 ) but I wanted to design a simpler alternative so this is what I came up with.

0,7860,High Strength Paracord Block and Tackle Pulley,Just for fun I designed a block and tackle with the intention of seeing if I could make one strong enough to old my own weight with paracord. This design used 6 pulleys to divide my 170 lb body weight 6 times into roughly 30 lbs input force. It was strong enough but it was hard to balance! So I later designed the mount and center holder to keep everything centered. The design is also modular so you could use more or less pulleys on the block if you wanted. According to my clevis calculator (available here: http://engineerdog.com/resources/) at 50% infill (ABS) this design is rated to withstand the 550 lb load that the paracord is supposed to break at.,21832,Michael Graham
0,7861,Super Strong Machinist Vice,"UPDATED 2/22/15: Added file: ""Slide Ver 2"", the red part seen in the photos. This version is much stronger, please watch the video. (I have removed the original slide stl as I no longer recommend using it). I have a mini mill but my existing vice is just junk. This Machinist Vice is a highly functional and was in my budget (a real one will set you back $250!). The part that makes this design strong is the steel plates cut to size and glued in plate to distribute forces. Check out the picture of the tin can I was able to smash. I've attached a printable layover sheet for the face plates. Another cool thing about this vice is that you can use in reverse for inside clamping of large objects. Also, the main lead screw doesn't move in and out as the slide moves which makes the mill handle underneath more accessible. http://youtu.be/HC69pqXPNkQ",21832,Michael Graham
0,7862,"If-Off-Stay-Off Box, power loss safety device","The if-off-stay-off box is a cheap tool for protecting electro-mechanical devices from damaging themselves following a power outage by preventing them from turning back on when the power returns. If the if-off-stay-off is unplugged and re-plugged in then it will remain OFF until the button is pressed (then it will remain ON until unplugged again). I designed this for a friend who was worried about his fish tank filter pump, which needed manual priming to operate properly and would be damaged if allowed to run dry (which would happen following a power outage). Of course an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is the preferred option for protecting devices during a power outage, but they also cost about $60. Perhaps you can think of alternatives uses for this device anyway; Practical jokes maybe?",21832,Michael Graham

0,7864,Sine Bars and Angle Block Set,"These are machine shop tools that offer different methods of holding a work piece at a desire angle. Professional shops use standard sized 5 inch and 3 inch sine bars to set precise angles. (In order to use sine bars you need to have gage blocks, see instructions tab for how to use.) The angle block set is a quick alternative method of setting an angle.The triangle blocks have the angles 5 degrees, 10 deg, and 30 deg which can be stacked to give you any angle between 5-45 deg, in 5 deg increments. (You place blocks in reverse to subtrct angles). The J shaped holder keeps them from sliding off of each other.",21832,Michael Graham
0,7865,Sliding T Bevel,"A sliding T bevel, also known as a bevel gauge, is an adjustable gauge for setting and transferring angles. These are really useful for woodworking and tile cutting.

0,7866,Light Flicker Detecting Top,"Use this device to identify energy inefficient light fixtures by their low frequency flickering! All you do is spin the top and look for a blinking bluish line to see if you could be using a better light fixture! Why This works: Fluorescent light bulbs flicker at twice the AC frequency because the magnetic ballast driving them is directly affected by the AC current peaks. So 60 Hz AC = 120 Hz flicker. Newer more efficient solid state fluorescent tube lights flicker at a much faster rate. This top has high contrasting colors spaced in such a way that when spun at low speed it will create a frame rate interference, just like when you look at your TV through a digital camera. The photos taken with the bluish lines are what you see with slow flickering light, the other two photos used sunlight which doesn't flicker and just makes a red white blur. NOTE: Some LED's have low flicker rates and will give you a false positive. Don't throw away your energy efficient LED's!",21832,Michael Graham
0,7867,Machinist Jack aka Screw Jack,"A machinist jack is a simple but extremely useful tool used in machine shops for leveling and supporting parts in a vice. It is particularly useful for long parts and parts on angles. A brand new steel set might cost you about $80, so consider this an affordable albeit light duty alternative.",21832,Michael Graham
0,7868,Tap Handles with Wood Insert Nuts,"A normal tap handle will probably run you about $20 and will honestly be a much more durable tool than this one. That said these handles do work very well, just don't over tighten them! I made this set mostly to experiment with a different method of inserting threads into 3D printed parts. As you can see I used a wood insert nut instead of a standard nut. This type of nut provides more threads and distributes the applied stress differently than a standard nut. The insert nut will also never accidentally fall out! I provided an stl file that can fit each type of nut so you can print one each to compare them directly. (Note, the tap handle stl files have the bolt holes positioned closer together than what is shown in the picture for added strength.)",21832,Michael Graham
0,7869,Parallels / Parallel Bar Set,"Parallels are used in machine shop environments to assist in measuring or holding work pieces in drill presses or milling machines. They are typically made of steel machined to tight tolerances and they usually sell for a couple hundred dollars. I've found that my 3d printer holds tolerances well enough to make this set for home use. The bars are 3/16"" thick, 4-1/2"" long, and vary in width from 3/8 to 1"" in 1/8"" increments.",21832,Michael Graham

I’d like to make them myself but I don’t usually have liquid nitrogen sitting around my house. Since I work with foundry equipment all day it wasn’t long before I asked myself ‘why not mold the ice cream’? Unfortunately I haven’t yet gotten the dots out whole because I only have ABS right now. (The picture I took makes it looks worse that it is, it could be improved with a bit of tinkering.) I've tried hot water (which hurt), nonstick spray (which helped), and hitting it really hard and yelling at it (didn't help). I’ll be trying an acetone smoothing next but any new ideas are welcome! This would definitely work much better if made out of a flexible material like silicone rubber. The funnel valve assembly does work well though, it holds water leak free!

Please support all Pinshape designers and""like"" if you collect or download their creations!
After doing my “Pinhole Printed” Kickstarter project in 2013, I wanted to create a new 3D printed pinhole camera that anyone with access to a 3D printer can make. I’ve designed a number of 3D printed cameras, including the very popular Flyer 6x6 and Clipper 6x18 cameras which are now in the New Mexico History Museum and in the Poetics of Light exhibition running through January 10, 2016.
The Easy 35 camera is fast, cheap, and easy to make. Based on 35mm film, the Easy 35 can be printed in half the time of a Flyer 6x6 and needs just a pinhole to assemble (at a bare minimum). A rubber band secures the top and black tape is used as the shutter. Such a camera appeals both to photographers and to educators wanting to teach principles of photography to youths. If you have a 3D printer, perhaps you can make some for a local school’s science class.
The Easy 35 body is printed as one piece, incorporating the film chambers, rails, internal light baffles, and pinhole mount. Such a camera body is only possible with a 3D printer, since it cannot be done in one piece with conventional manufacturing techniques.
This is an open source camera, using the Creative Commons CC-BY-SA 4.0 license, meaning anyone is free to make them or even sell them, as long as attribution is given to the designer and any remixes or derivations are shared alike.
Be sure to read the PDF on Making the Easy 35 before you start - it contains printing, assembly, and operating instructions. Details on the Easy 35 camera can be found on www.pinholeprinted.com, including where to find ready-made pinholes.

0,7916,Sharps Disposal Container,"Safely dispose of Xacto knife blades, single edge razors, double edge razors, box cutters, utility knife blades, carpet blades. Keep old blades away from harm. Oval cylinder - 31mm x 38mm x 90mm high. Walls are tough and 3mm thick, print in one piece with 30+% infill. Tape over the slot and throw in the trash safely without worrying that someone will cut their fingers on loose blades. Design makes it difficult to shake out blades but it can be done, so tape over the slot before disposal.",1150,Pinholeprinted
0,7917,120 Takeup Spool for 35mm Film (1),"Do you have a 120 film camera? Want to shoot images with the sprocket holes exposed? Want to shoot specialty films that are not available in 120 format? If so, or you just like to play with film, these adapters are for you. This takeup spool winds up 35mm film onto a 120 format spool. The matching 35mm film adapter is at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:323120. There are two STL files, one with and one without supports. The supports are necessary - the one without supports requires setting your slicer to generate supports. If in doubt, print the one with supports. The supports are easily cleared away with a twist of your fingers. These were designed for the Flyer 6x6 camera developed as a result of the Pinhole Printed Kickstarter project (http://www.pinholeprinted.com) but can be used in any 120 medium format camera.

0,7918,3D Printer Filament Spool,"Tested and working - open source, quick, simple, standard (2"" PVC connector available at any hardware store). Used when your filament comes on a crappy cardboard spool. Print 2 sides and use PVC glue to glue sides onto a standard 2"" PVC pipe connector. 180mm in diameter and takes a full 1kg of filament, rolls easily on 3/4"" PVC pipe. Needs an 8x8 bed. If you scale it down, it won't fit the 2"" PVC connector. I use a battery powered drill and a bolt glued into a 3/4"" PVC pipe, taped up, to respool from a cardboard spool. Works well and I no longer get jams from the cardboard sides spreading and the filament falling into the crack.",1150,Pinholeprinted
0,7919,35mm Film on 120 Spool,"UPDATES 10/29/14 - Added the matching spool - thing: 522005 10/7/14 - Added a combined STL 7/6/14 - I've added a PDF Read Me guide to using the adapter 6/16/14 - updated files to improve fit and reduce friction. May be loose on some commercial canisters but will now fit CineStill film and possibly Kalt. Print using 50% infill. Tested and working. This adapts 35mm film canisters to work as a 120 format spool, and allows shooting 35mm film in any 120 medium format film camera. The 35mm film is centered on the 120 spool. Using this adapter allows using films that are not available in 120 format, and the entire 35mm film is exposed, resulting in images out to the edges, sprocket holes and all, resulting in a unique effect. You may also want the matching spool at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:522005 Do not force adapters on. Make sure the splines are aligned and if tight, trim/sand or wiggle on carefully. The splines may need to be trimmed to fit Kalt bulk loading canisters and some others. The hole for viewing the film number (usually a red window) on the camera must be taped over with black gaffer's tape or some suitable opaque tape to avoid back side exposure of the film. You will need to wind blindly about 1-1/2 turns at the beginning and taper down to 1-1/4 turn at the end. Most medium format cameras have no rewind, so you will need to unload the film in a darkroom or changing bag and manually rewind the 35mm film back into its canister. When processing, specify ""process only"" and ""do not cut"" and cut the film yourself. These were designed for the Flyer 6x6 camera developed as a result of the Pinhole Printed Kickstarter project (pinholeprinted.com) but can be used in any 120 medium format camera. The combined STL is printed as is. If using the individual parts, the bottom STL part is printed as is and the top STL part must first be rotated 180 degrees about X or Y to sit flat on the bed for printing. Now recommending 50% infill due to the small cross-section of the splines. If you do not have a 3D printer or have it tied up with other things, check at http://www.pinholeprinted.com/order/35mm-film-to-120-spool-adapter/ for alternatives. This is CC by SA 3.0 - this means anyone can freely print or even sell the adapters - but you must provide attribution if you do so. You can print a Thing Tag right off this page and display it if demonstrating your printer capabilities or distribute it with any copies you sell.",1150,Pinholeprinted
0,7920,"E3D Cooling Fan (for v5, not v6)","UPDATES * 6/4/14 - I have added a version 3 STL file that increases the room for the fan, and also removes built-in support since that has been difficult to get out. The new Slic3r supposedly has much better support generation. This is untested - if you print it, please comment on your results. Original v2 STL - while the 2 breakout sections are somewhat difficult to remove, the CAD view does show the yellow breakout sections - just do it slowly and carefully. This cooling fan has been in continuous use for 2 months now printing cameras from my Kickstarter Pinhole Printed project (www.pinholeprinted.com). It works very well and as yet, I have not seen a need to improve on it by using a second fan. This is a cooling fan for my E3D, mounted in a Solidoodle 3. The original hot end plugged up once too often and so I installed my E3D, which works really well. However, the E3D has its own fan and the size makes mounting a separate print cooling fan difficult. So I combined the two into one 40mm fan, which runs continuously. Two-thirds of the airflow goes to the E3D heatsink and one-third is diverted to cool the print. There's no control over the airflow to the print. It's not perfect but it works pretty well and doesn't reduce the build volume of the Solidoodle 3 anymore than the E3D did. The cooling circle is partial to allow for the E3D heater and thermistor wires. How I'd put it - if you're not having a problem with hot filament, you don't need this. If you want to cool your filament some, then try this. Be sure to check the instructions, now that it's under another tab.",1150,Pinholeprinted
0,7923,Cool Birdhouse v2,"I liked the concept of using a CD as the bottom, inspired by Gyrobot, both for drainage and easy cleaning, plus shortening the time to print. So I modified the Cool Birdhouse to take a CD/DVD for a bottom. See Cool Birdhouse for additional info about the design and instructions. Kudos to Gyrobot and the Birdhouse Bauble for inspiring the use of CDs!
Added a CD as the base - you must print this at actual scale (1:1) for this to work. Otherwise, print the original Cool Birdhouse or use the CD model provided by Gyrobot. Note that there is a bridging challenge at the base, so your printer must be well-tuned. There are a number of bridging and torture test models out there to aid you in tuning your settings.",1150,Pinholeprinted
0,7924,Tension Nut Filament Guide,"I added a filament guide, based on my tension nut, so I don't need to worry about the filament looping off the roll on a long unattended print job. The tension nut is tight enough that it doesn't need a screw to hold it in place though you can add one if you need it. The hole has a large fillet on both sides so the filament will pass through easily and the arm should accommodate various spools. You can add a small square of foam in front of it and push the filament through. The foam will clean off any loose dust or particles on the filament before it gets to your extruder.",1150,Pinholeprinted
0,7925,Solidoodle Carry Handle and Spool Holder,"These combine a carry handle and spool holder for the Solidoodle 3 into a single unit, one left and one right, which makes moving the S3 much simpler. I had previously printed gsterley's Solidoodle Spool Holder Mk2 (thing:97734) and fredhag's wire guide (thing:94675) but needing to carry my S3 around prompted me to create these with the wire guide included. Use a section of 3/4"" PVC for the spool holder and my tension nuts (seen in the pics) at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:116872, and filament guide (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:117621).",1150,Pinholeprinted
0,7926,"Tension Nut for 3/4"" PVC Pipe","Keep things in place on a 3/4"" PVC pipe. I use these to keep my spools from wandering all over during a print job. I started with gsterley's Solidoodle Spool Holder Mk2, but now use them with my own. They keep a tight grip on the pipe but flex to accommodate variances in pipe diameter.",1150,Pinholeprinted
0,7927,Cool Birdhouse,"This is a double shell, solar-vented cool birdhouse, printable in one piece. Your chicks will thank you! There is a drain at the bottom and a ring of ventilation holes at the bottom and top of the inner shell, and another ring of slots and holes at the bottom and top of the outer shell. Any sunlight on the outer shell sets up a convection cycle with cooler air being drawn in through the lower ring of slots and rising to exit the large holes, so the inner shell and nest remain cooler. A post and ring joins the two shells at the top for a sturdy hanger. The roof, lack of a perch, and gap between shells makes it difficult for a predator to reach the eggs or chicks. There's no bird bath because chicks won't appreciate the resulting disturbance or encouragement of predators, and the opening is high enough that the chicks won't fall out before they are ready. Please let me know how you do! I used http://www.drsfostersmith.com/pic/article.cfm?aid=2194 as a guide to design. Sizing - check. Heating and cooling - check, but there's no insulation for winter except to cover exterior holes to trap dead air. Proper drainage - check. Safety - check, while there's no metal plate, there are two openings that would have to be enlarged, and a squirrel would have trouble hanging on anyway. Mounting and access - check/fail. There is no cleanout plug - you'll have to use a hooked wire and fish out all the nesting materials to clean it out.  Look at v2 for one with a removable CD bottom.",1150,Pinholeprinted
0,7929,Sphere Piggy Bank,"I needed a piggy bank for my loose coins but I'm not crazy about pigs in the bedroom. Traditional style - shake 'em out or break it. With these, you can probably break it cleanly on a seam with a razor and superglue it back together a few times. This is a ~5"" sphere (200mm) and holds a lot. If you want something smaller, I suggest scaling it by 0.8 for 4"" or 0.6 for 3"". Christmas tip - print smaller ones for your children, fill them up with loose change throughout the year, and then give them the spheres under the tree. This is printable, but it may be a challenge and the top won't be as clean (see photo). For appearance, the pyramid (thing:105742) may be a better choice. Update note - I'd recommend printing this at 0.8 size, not full size, (about 4"") to go with the pyramid. Should make it slightly easier to print.",1150,Pinholeprinted

0,7985,Marvin the Martian Ray Gun,"THIS IS NOT A REAL 3D PRINTED GUN!
Sorry I thought I'd start with the disclaimer since '3D Printed Gun' can cause a bit of fuss at the moment! This gun was created to replicate the classic Marvin the Martian Ray Gun from Looney Tunes, to be used as a prop with a costume. If you glue things in correctly, the trigger actually moves, and the dial on the back to control the size of your KABOOM turns as well. Make sure you slot these parts into position as you glue the 2 halves of the body together, following the exploded view shown in the images.
The parts were split this way to fit on an Up! Plus 2 printer, and minimise support material requirements. Super glue is great for gluing everything together, some undercoat and sanding to clean things up, and a nice yellow spray paint to finish things off.

0,8066,X-Men Cyclops Goggles,"“Don’t anybody move!… I lost my contact lens.”
This is the X-Men Cyclops Goggles designed by me for a costume party. They print out nicely in 4 pieces, which I did on my 'Up! Plus 2' 3D printer using the 0.2mm layer thickness. I've added joints to the parts so it's really easy to locate and glue together, and will be nice and strong. You can see the dimensions they've been designed for in one of the images - if your head is smaller or larger just scale the prints to suit. 
I also added some foam to the ear pieces (which slot over your ears like glasses) just to create a firm fit on my head. I designed these to be suitable for anyone to wear, so you may find little tweaks like this are necessary to get the perfect fit.
For the red visor I simply cut a piece off a translucent red folder and glued it, so you can still see out while wearing them. Also some red LED's make a great feature! To get the smooth finish I applied multiple coats of a spray putty, sanded, and then spray painted the final colour. I then hand-painted the black details in the recessed sections.

The bottom (black part) was at a higher speed, extruder height, etc., then for the actual owl (white) I used a much slower printing speed with a higher resolution.  To get the two colors I paused the print at the layer in which the owl was started and changed the filament.  Then gave it an acetone vapor bath to smooth things out a bit.

The first fully printable airplane with suitable files prepared for your 3D printer. Flight characteristics are comparable or even better than classic model airplanes. Simply download and then print it anytime you need only for $10 (filament cost). Both the wings and the fuselage feature extensive high-tech, 3d structural reinforcement which makes the model very rigid while still maintaining a lightweight airframe and exact airfoil even when it is made only from plastic. This perfect and exact 3d structure is possible only due to additive 3d printing technology. So welcome to the 21th century of model flying. Be the first at your airfield with this new technology. Of course we comply with the ACES air combat rules.
Easy to assembly, you do not need any extra tool or hardware, you only need to glue printed parts together. The rest of the assembly is very easy. Simply add brushless motor, ESC, servos and radio system. Don´t worry, a detailed step by step PDF/VIDEO is included. You will get superb performance airplane with high power efficiency which will let you fly 7+ minutes at full throttle while exceeding 150 kph.

0,8137,ZYYX Spool Holder For Side Placement,"When i rearranged my printers at home my ZYYX printer ended up in a corner and suddenly changing spools became cumbersome. So i designed a spoolholder to mount on the side of the machine to simplify changing spools.
The handle will snap in place and the spoolholder itself which is positioned to the left of the handle is mounted just as the regular spoolholder on the back.
Be aware that if you are using the filament detector this might cause problems, i might add some more parts later to deal with this.
While this is designed to be mounted on the printers right side, you can easily mirror it and make a left side verion.

Although it does a decent job we felt we needed to add a trailer to get the most of it so we designed this trailer where the box is about half the size of the original truck.
Connect the trailer to the dumptruck and attach the lock pin and washer to secure the trailer to the dumo truck.

By that I mean this part will hold real water and not leak. I have printed several vase-like parts before, and they all leaked when I put water in them. This makes such parts far less useful than if they were water tight.
This part has double walls - not counting the spiral ribs which are really just decoration - and each wall is made with 4 loops. The bottom is also double walled with each surface made with 4 layers.
The second photo shows what a layer height of 0.300 mm looks like. Normally I use 0.200 mm, but I wanted to see if increasing this as a way to reduce total print time would be OK. The final result is not as good as 0.200 mm, but I still think it is acceptable.

0,8217,GuerillaBeam slide holder,"GuerillaBeam is a modular flashlight image projector.
A gBeam projector consists of this slide holder (holding slides and add-ons) and screw-in adapters for lenses and lights. Thus, this slide holder is compatible with virtually any lens and most LED lights.
What to expect:
With a 1000 Lumen (10W) flashlight, the brightness will be  comparable to a 100W classic slide projector.
Depending on the lens used, projection range is between 0.1m and 150m. Image quality is usually worse than with conventional projectors, but good enough  (using slides printed on overhead transparencies). 
Compatible devices:
current SLR camera lenses (Canon, Nikon, Pentax and compatible)
old SLR lenses (M42*, T2*, Canon FD**, Minolta SR, Praktica B, Rollei QBM, Contax, and many more)
projector lenses with (standard) tube diameters of 42, 52 and 62mm
TrustFire X8 flashlights (most recommended)
many other LED flashlights, MR16 and GU10 LED spotlights
How to make:
Firstly, determine the thickness of your 35mm slide mounts. There's one version for slides with up to 2.00mm thickness (i.e. Agfa CS), and another one for thick slides  up to 2.5mm.  (Other sizes available on request).
1. Print the slide holder.
Wall thickness of 0.8mm and layer height <0.2mm is recommended. Assuming there are no major defects in your print, this will suffice to support lenses up to 2kg.
Recommended infill percentage is 23%. With greater wall strengths, it can also be zero.
This part (only) absolutely needs support material. Its only a minimal amount at the slide slot, but it's crucial. Using Cura, automatic support generation for overhangs >51% will work perfectly. With other slicers you might have to try something else. Inspect the support material generated by your slicer carefully, because otherwise you might not be able to remove it.
If you have trouble printing, I give support..
If you'd like a finished slide holder you can order it here.
2. Install a fresnel condensor lens:
For optimal brightness and FOV the slide holder has to be equipped with a fresnel lens. Such a lens can be obtained by inserting a credit card magnifier lens  into the slide holder. Cut the lens to the size of 38x48mm and insert them to the corresponding slots on the inside of the slide holder (use rubber gloves).
Select lens and light: 1. Lights
A good basic light can be any focused Cree XM-L flashlight. Those are sold from $10 upwards and typically use 18650 batteries. Especially suited is the TrustFire X8 (or the UltraFire X8 but the latter has annoying electronics). Lights with multiple LEDs (like ThruNite TN30 or Sky Ray King) can give even brighter images, but yield lower efficiency and can cause heat problems.
2. Lenses
Any lens with an  f-number of 2.8 or less will work fine, provided there's an adapter for it. Slower lenses (f/3.5, f/4, etc.)  will work too, but only with significantly reduced brightness and image quality.

0,8220,Chess Set - Profiles - Mk1,"This is the first in my series of profiles chess piece designs.

Like my other sets this set is designed to be played, so while design elements are important, it is equally important that they are each distinctive enough in look to be easily recognizable. The pieces are also designed to be easily gripped between two fingers when playing. The King stands just over 4"" tall and as 1 3/4"" at the base.

0,8228,Chest Mount Harness for GoPro cameras,"Chest Mount Harness to use with you GoPro camera. I use a Hero 3 so i´m not sure how it will fit newer cameras like Hero 4.
The Harenss Lock might be a bit bulky and maybe not the most clever solution but it works and i´m sure someone can come up with a great replacement!
If you are thinking of using this it´s important to consider the conditions where you are about to use the mount. High or low temperatures for example can affect the durability of such a mount to the extent that it can break.
Unfortunately there are so many variables that affects the quality of a print so i think it´s also important to say that if you use this mount it´s at your own risk. If unsure maybe it´s better to just buy one in the store.
You need to 3D Print the following pieces:
3 pcs Adjustment Buckle
1 pcs Back Buckle
1 pcs Chest Mount
1 pcs Harness Lock Part 1
1 pcs Harness Lock Part 2
And you need to buy:
Approx 1,5 metres 50mm Nylon Webbing (I used about 1,5 meter, but of course that may vary depending of your size)
Hopefully you can figure out how to put it together according to the pictures. =)

When you wake up, you'll have a mum and dad, and you won't even remember me. Well, you'll remember me a little. I'll be a story in your head. But that's OK: we're all stories, in the end. Just make it a good one, eh? Because it was, you know, it was the best: a daft old man, who stole a magic box and ran away. Did I ever tell you I stole it? Well, I borrowed it; I was always going to take it back. Oh, that box, Amy, you'll dream about that box. It'll never leave you. Big and little at the same time, brand-new and ancient, and the bluest blue, ever. And the times we had, eh? Would've had. Never had. In your dreams, they'll still be there. The Doctor and Amy Pond... and the days that never came. [Notices that the crack is closing] The Doctor: The cracks are closing. But they can't close properly 'til I'm on the other side.

0,8527,The Quasar Puzzle v2,"An original twisty puzzle design of mine, based off of a building-block prototype that my friends and I threw together on a rainy day at our middle-school's Rubik's Cube Club. Later, when I saw how even the ""non-cubers"" at my school enjoyed interacting with and manipulating what we had made, I decided to take it upon myself to build a version that didn't fall apart in their hands, one that was fun and functional. I built prototypes out of wood, clay, legos, and anything else I could find. I tried my hand in resin casting and mold making, all the while attempting to perfect the mechanism. Now here I am, in July, four months later, with what I believe to be the final iteration of the Quasar Puzzle. I learned a lot about Solidworks while working on this project. In the end, after dozens of different designs that looked better on paper than the real world, I came up with a facepalm-ingly simple design that uses 8x 3/4"" 6-32 Machine Screws and 8x 6-32 Hex Nuts to connect 8 identical 3D Printed parts into a simple puzzle.

This makes such parts far less useful than if they were water tight. This part has double walls - not counting the spiral ribs which are really just decoration - and each wall is made with 4 loops. The bottom is also double walled with each surface made with 4 layers. The second photo shows what a layer height of 0.300 mm looks like. Normally I use 0.200 mm, but I wanted to see if increasing this as a way to reduce total print time would be OK. The final result is not as good as 0.200 mm, but I still think it is acceptable. I used Craftware to slice the part, after running the original STL file through 3D Builder to correct errors. Total print time for this part was 11 hours 11 minutes.",16681,Birk Binnard

Print one of each of the 2 parts. Use epoxy to glue the bolt into the main mount, be sure to push it in all the way (screw a nut onto it until dry to hold it tightly in place.
Then epoxy the nut into the finger nut but be sure you don't end up with epoxy in the threads.
Once the epoxy cures, simply screw the finger nut onto the bolt (open nut side facing the mount) and it's ready to use.

0,8560,ZYYX Fan Duct,"I needed a more efficient filament cooling solution when printing PLA in my ZYYX 3D printer and so i decided to switch to a centrifugal fan.
Designing the duct was not an easy task, very limited space all the way down thru the extruder carriage and further down to the hotend/nozzle thus the slightly awkward and not the most efficient design. If the duct comes to close to the build plate use an exacto knife to carefully shorten it at the bottom. The duct should lock into place securely as should the fan when mounted. It´s important to note that even though the MB has a 24V output ZYYX uses a 12V fan. So if your going to use a 12V version of the new fan your all good but if your going witht the 24V version you need to remove the resistors (see picture) to get the most out of you new fan!

You'd be scraping support plastic off the underside of this model for days if you printed the original, but thanks to a little trick I picked up at the Make: Magazine 2015 Digital Fabrication Shootout the need for support is much, much reduced. All's you gots to do is rotate the model roughly 225° so its feet are pointing skyward and manually put in a few supports in your software of choice. This technique should work for many humanoid models. I also added a circular base. A little super glue or epoxy should hold things together.",10770,zheng3

It resembles todayâ€™s sets in most respects, but two of the pieces are different, so the set is actually a precursor of the modern version of the game, whose rules mostly arose in the late 15th century. In the museumâ€™s set, instead of queens, there are viziers, and instead of bishops, there are elephants, which were called fils, according to â€œMasterpieces From the Department of Islamic Art in the Metropolitan Museum of Art,â€� a book about the exhibition that is being published by the museum. The viziers and the elephants moved differently, and were less powerful, than their modern counterparts, which probably made the game slower and less exciting. The viziers could only move or capture diagonally one square at a time; the modern queen is allowed unlimited movement in any direction. The elephants moved diagonally two squares at a time, while modern bishops can move any number of diagonal squares. The viziers could never attack each other. Chess had started to spread to Europe a couple of centuries before the Metropolitanâ€™s Persian set was made and had already moved closer to the modern game there. The Lewis Chessmen, a trove of 93 pieces found in 1831 on the Isle of Lewis, in Scotland, which are believed to have been carved between 1150 and 1200 A.D., contain queens and bishops. (Thirty of the pieces will be on loan from the British Museum from Nov. 15 through April 22, 2012 at The Cloisters in Washington Heights.)""",12852,MakeALot

In December, I received a sample set of coloured PLA from Faberdashery and I wanted to make something that showed off the range of colours without needing too much of any particular one.

I'm sure there are plenty of good spools out on Thingiverse already, and I'm sure I should reference half of them as inspirational to this one. I couldn't find one that was a direct replacement for the MakerBot spool, which is what I wanted. I've posted it in-case someone else is pulling their hair out trying to manage with just one, like me... The filament guide is just a quick hack, but it also works as an adjustable break and slides onto the top of the ToM.

Golf Tee,"Here's a video of me explaining the tee... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYPQPmdKJSA&feature=youtu.be Here's a Golf Mutli-Tool (Divot Tool, Bottle Opener, Ball Marker holder, Key chain) I made with custom ball markers."" http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:947119 This is a golf tee I designed to actually be a good tee... I tried my best to leave as little surface contact with the tee and the ball (I even did math) ... I accomplished low surface contact/friction, while still keeping the ball on the tee without it falling off - it's actually quite stable on the tee... I also angled the crown so that when a driver is about to strike the ball - it will always hit the ball before the tee... This is a very low friction design and I believe it will actually be a good golfing tee... It is actually pretty strong and should stand up to a few drives... Maybe even a entire 18 holes (unless, of course, you forget to pick it up... Just .print the tee with a lot of shells - like 5-7... It will be very strong if your add a lot of shells. It should take between 25-60 minutes to print depending on your settings... So try it out and tell me what you think... Enjoy!!!",15795,JJPowelly
0,8813,Universal Spool Holder v2.0,"This is a full redesign of my popular, but old and relatively weak spool holder that I designed nearly two years ago... Old, Obsolete Spool Holder: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:290064 Here's a video of me explaining everything you need to know about the redesign... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyQ8u1Kn0mM&feature=youtu.be This new design is 100% better - I completely redesigned my screws and spinner bolts for better tolerance for 3d Printing... My old screws were good if they were machined, but they were way too fine to be 3D printed well... So I made the threading much better and made the screws much stronger... I also added a lot of structural features that I explain in the video... Here's a list of what I did in the new design. Made both arms (the base and the spinner) 2.5mm shorter in height, I also added fillets to every corner so every contour is nice and rounded. Redid the bolt pattern and made that easier on the hand while spinning the spinner bolt. Increased the diameter of the screws and added 45 degree chamfers for strength... Screws are very strong now. Redid all the threading... This will thread smooth and tight right off the printer - I had 100% success rate on prints. Added a hole on the lower Rods to hold ends of filament to keep them from unraveling or raveling in - resulting in getting the spool tangled up. This is now about a 33% decrease in total print time from my old design... Overall, it should take about 6-7 hours to print an entire holder on a standard .2mm layer setting... But you can speed it up by going .3mm and everything will be perfect... Infill is not a big issue... 15-20% should do it... If you want everything to look nice on the outside - do 3 perimeter shells. Other than all of that - this should work for everyone and will fit on 95% of spools... The only two spools that I know do not fit are Makerbot's newer long, skinny spools and Taulman spools... Which I actually made a spool holder specifically for... You can find the Taulman spool holder here... http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:938437 **I hope you find this spool holder useful... Thanks for reading... ENJOY!!!",15795,JJPowelly
0,8814,Taulman Spool Holder,"Here's a video explaining the spool holder... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcPFLtofpFk&feature=youtu.be This is my solution to fix common problems related to Taulman brand Spools... This design is based roughly on a popular Spool holder design I made a few years ago... http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:290064 ... Taulman makes great filament, but their spools are packed to the brim, very tight, with no place the keep the end of the filament controlled... This causes a lot of the spool to completely unwind everywhere... You can either cut it off and waste the filament, or try to wrap it back up and risk getting a snag or your spool locking up later while printing.... My spool holder has a place to keep the end of the filament held... And lockers which lock the spool in place - restricting it from spinning when you don't want it to spin... The dimensions of the spool holder are near perfect, so everything will fit and screw in well - even on low resolution... Thanks for viewing my spool holder - be sure to like it... I hope you find it useful!!!",15795,JJPowelly

0,8816,LIGHTSABER - LED - Fully Functional,"This is a 3D printed Light Saber I designed as a personal project to keep myself occupied and to submit it in the #lightitup challenge Here's a demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhZpyn2MeaM&feature=youtu.be Let me start off by saying this is a very easy print/make... The handle only has two main prints and you have the option of printing either 6 individual sliding cylinders or print one with all of them already embedded... Every print can be printed on a single extruder, no print requires any supports, and the tallest print is 155mm high on the Z axis... So as long as your printer can print 155 in the Z, you can make this no problem... The only thing you will need to buy is this LED light and remote for $10.... http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FS7N0J8?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00 I used Bendlay filament for the cylinders mostly because it lets a lot of light pass through is (91%) and it is also a lot stronger than PLA... It is pretty expensive, but totally worth it for this project... If you desire, you can also print the cylinders in natural PLA/ABS or any translucent filament you want to use... However, you wont get the same glow you get with Bendlay...

0,8834,Universal Spool Holder,"THIS IS AN OBSOLETE VERSION OF THIS SPOOL HOLDER Here is a completely redesigned version of this spool holder that is 100x better in nearly every way... http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:943563/#instructions THIS IS AN OBSOLETE VERSION OF THIS SPOOL HOLDER Here's a video explaining how this spool holder works... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmDmW-NRSjM&feature=youtu.be Here's a similar spool holder I made for Taulman brand filaments... http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:938437 Prints entirely in one print, if you want Extremely Stable with perfect dimensions Connects and assembles brilliantly Rigorously designed to be as durable as possible Engineered with the utmost mathematical rigor Completely portable - works and supports wonderfully, without any issue, while PLA is printing from the spool... Easiest PLA color swaps to the extruder imaginable. *With various sized rods in the thing files, you can make this fit almost any spool... I've gotten it to fit on over 7 brands including Makerbot, Hatchbox, Gizmodorks, Ninjaflex, 3dxtech, prototype supply, etc... Pretty much every one... This was my first big project after purchasing my replicator... I spent a lot of time making this, and I'm very proud of the finished product... After unboxing my Makerbot and printing all the stock prints that came on the SD card, I was wondering what should be my first ""thing""... Since I had about 3 spools that I purchased with my bot just laying around - sad, lonely and with no place to call home, I decided I should make them all a little cradle to rest in happily ever after, because - afterall - I LOVE to keep my amazing little robot happy, therefore, I make damn sure to take diligent care of my Makerbot's food... So far our relationship has been fantastic - Makerbot and I - however the first real dislike I had with my Makerbot was the stubbornly perplexing spool holder thing that came with the machine. A spool holder that grudgingly attaches to the back of the machine - only to refuse to want to come back off to change spools, at least not without first waging all out war on my increasingly fragile emotions. Basically, I found it difficult to change spools quickly, effectively and without issue using that damn thing. So I decided my spool holder should be designed so that it could simply be placed in the back of the printer, without any adjustments, and feed straight into the extruder while cozily chilling in its sweet little cradle. Overall, I wanted to make it elegant yet practical, while using the simplest and most discrete design possible. I went through a lot of ideas - my original designs look absolutely nothing like this one - but through extensive prototyping, I arrived at a design and final product I'm satisfied with. The coolest feature, I think, is the spinning nuts located in the connector arm... (Which I have as its own thing for use in any prototype you want on my page - see - ""NeverLost Nut & Bolt Spinny Thing"")... The part is cool in that the nut is permanently confined within any ""thing"" you add it to - it will never fall out - yet still prints as one piece without ever fusing to the shell surrounding it... It is designed in a way that allows it to spin freely while never separating from the shell or bigger part that encompesses it. The complementary hollowed out base containing a perfectly sized and scaled screw that is located in the geometrical center of the base, slips flawlessly into the nut with little to no need for alignment or effort - all while still maintaining a very tight grip... Another awesome design feature of the ""thing"" is - due to the nut's free range of motion and the hollowed base the screw rests in, creates a - never fail - super tight grip between the two pieces, thus optimizing the connection... While the nut tightens, it sinks into its shell, this applies a strong force against the shell and thus the entire part - more importantly though - due to this sinking - while it tightens it concurrently extrudes through the bottom and snugly enters the hollow base surrounding the screw, further tightening the grip and adding a much needed level of support to the fragile plastic screw. These mechanics are much more durable and effective when compared to simply screwing two pieces together along flush surfaces with no snatch or support to defend against unwanted torque. The one inherent flaw of building with plastic material is that it has a very high risk of breaking or snapping when small support pieces are over torqued. This unavoidable weakness is a contingency that I make sure to address while engineering everything I design in an effort to maximize the durability of everything I build... It's kind of hard to explain this feature without visual aid, but if you print this thing and try it out - you'll see exactly what I'm saying. All in all, it provides a lot of longevity and durability to the apparatus entirely. This was a very tedious little part that I became very obsessive with designing. It took me an entire weekend, about 50 prototypes and nearly an entire spool of PLA to perfect - however - I managed to get the dimensions synced perfectly down to < 0.1mm... So, unlike OJ's bloody glove, this thing will slide on effortlessly, and without acquittal. Although this piece (my ""nut and bolt"" thing, not this spool thing) takes less than about half an hour to print in standard quality, I've successfully printed it in every level of quality makerbot offers and it work",15795,JJPowelly
0,8835,NeverLost Nut & Bolt Spinny Thing,"This thing was originally a small part of a bigger project I made (See http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:290064 )... However, I decided to upload it as its own thing when I realized it can easily be imported and added to any design or thing anyone wants to make that requires fastening of separate parts with a nut and screw... The part is cool in that the nut is permanently confined within any ""thing"" you add it to - it will never fall out - yet still prints as one piece without ever fusing to the shell surrounding it... It is designed in a way that allows it to spin freely while never separating from the shell or bigger part that encompasses it. With the spinner, I also provided a hollowed out base containing a perfectly sized and scaled screw. Located in the geometrical center of the base, the screw flawlessly slips into the nut with little to no aligning or effort - all while still maintaining a very tight grip...",15795,JJPowelly
0,8836,"4-way 3/4"" PVC Connector","This is a good 4-way PVC connector for building projects that use PVC piping. It's very useful in that a PVC connector with this shape is near impossible to find in any hardware store; due mostly to that fact there is really no practical sense to use this shaped connector in plumbing - which is, after all, PVC's primary function... However, PVC also makes for a great and very inexpensive building material that provides great support when used structurally in prototypes and projects - so I saw a niche that needed filling in the world of PVC connecting and decided to make this... It can be scaled to and universally fits any sized PVC and/or other piping that has a hollow circular hole in the center. I utilized a hexagonal shape that provides a flat, solid stick to the building platform so that the print can easily and effectively be made in one piece, without fear of warping... A polygonal shape also provides better fastening to the pipe than a circular shape would due to air displacement and the difficulty of scaling a perfect fit. It may intuitively seem simple to create two circular objects that, when put together, form a tight fight - however - in practice - it's actually a very difficult task to accomplish... If you think you have a good idea for improvement Feel free to make it better or more efficient. But please make sure to upload your improvements so I can see them - I always appreciate a good improvement... This piece is a great tool to use in the making of so many things with PVC - So keep on making!!!",15795,JJPowelly

0,8848,ProfTweak - a MakerWare profile editor,"Update: Should now work correctly with Makerbot Desktop / generation 5 profiles. If you are using v1.2 or v1.3 upgrade to v1.4! The prior versions had a bug that could mess up boolean values. Latest info on ProfTweak is always at: http://nothinglabs.blogspot.com/2013/09/introducing-proftweak-makerware-profile.html ProfTweak lives at the Github URL: https://github.com/nothinglabs/proftweak (or just download the zip file attached to this Thing) MAC USERS: See important note below if you're getting an error. What ProfTweak Does: Provides a simple GUI to access MakerWare slicer profile settings Toggle between a complete list of settings (there are a lot) and a smaller ""Common Settings"" list Add notes to your profiles Option to save as ""ProfTweakTemp"" profile for one-off experiments Windows, Mac and Linux versions (someone let me know if the Linux version actually works...) ProfTweak was written in Processing using the G4P GUI library (these are great resources - but next app I will probably try something not Java-based). ProfTweak requires Java. If ProfTweak won't run - you may need to install it. ProfTweak is licensed under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/. General Notes and Usage (aka documentation) I've tested ProfTweak - and it seems to work for me. But there may be bugs - awful bugs! I can't say with certainty it won't do something terrible to your brand-new Replicator 2x. Don't bug the nice people at MakerBot support about issues you encounter while using profiles generated by ProfTweak. ProfTweak requires an existing custom profile to start with. You might want to create an unadulterated custom profile from inside MakerWare based on the ""Standard"" (and maybe ""Low"" / ""High"") to base future profiles on. ProfTweak won't modify the built-in MakerWare profiles. When you create a new profile from within ProfTweak it copies the supporting files (end.gcode, start.gcode, profile.json) to a new folder - as well as writing out a new miracle.json file based on your modifications. ProfTweak stores its settings in proftweak.json found in the DATA folder under the folder where the app is installed. ProfTweak should generally find your MakerWare profile folder - but if it doesn't - you can specify it manually in proftweak.json (Linux users will probably need to do this). If you're a Windows user and find you need to set your profile folder - format it like this: ""C:/Users/Rich/My Things/Profiles/"" If you want to add / remove common items you can do so by modifying proftweak.json. ---Mac Users--- If you get an error ""proftweak.app is damaged and can't be opened"" - it's likely due to your Gatekeeper settings requiring apps be signed. See http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5290 for the solution. If you associate .json files with ProfTweak - MakerWare will launch it automatically when you select ""Edit profile."" The Windows setup package can do this for you automatically. ProfTweak reformats the .json in any profile it edits. This makes it less human-readable (MakerWare seems OK with it). When you modify a number - ProfTweak deals with it as a float. As a result .15 becomes 0.15000000596046448. This shouldn't make a meaningful difference when slicing - but it might make a small one. Saving in ProfTweak is always a manual operation. If you close without saving - you've closed without saving! Have fun!!!

The heart chakra is the fourth, where love, balance, forgiveness and hope rest. The fifth chakra is located in the throat and is all about communication.

0,8887,Ancient Flying Machines,"Upon seeing photographs of the ancient golden artifacts that look like a cross between jets and animals, I was immediately intrigued by the idea of technologically superior beings (be they gods, aliens or whatever) zooming around in these gorgeous aircrafts. 3d printing provides us with the perfect avenue to find out for ourselves whether the ancients were onto something with these designs or whether their imaginations were just running wild. Thus far, I have not succeeded in making my prints fly for more than a few seconds. However, this is not surprising given the fact that the originals do not have large wing-spans and therefore they cannot be expected to work like some of the ingenious ""glider"" designs here on Thingiverse. Their shape is more like the powerful jets that military organizations use today. Indeed, while several enthusiasts have succeeded in making models based on the artifacts fly in recent years, they have always managed it by installing a motor and using radio controls. I confess that this is beyond my own capabilities at the moment and therefore I leave these designs here to you fellow makers, in the hopes that one day one of you will improve or add to them so that they can take to the skies. ... In the meantime, they can be hung from strings and simply swing in the summer breeze.

My eventual plan is to expand this out into something of more of a functional pachinko game.

0,8907,Vintage Chumby Clock Radio,"I've been wanting to do a case modded Chumby for quite some time. I bought the Chumby One for $50 quite a long time ago from Woot and started it up once then tore it apart. It sat like that for a while, then I bought the radio off ebay. Luckily the clock opening was close to the correct size for the Chumby screen. I sat on it for a while until I got my Makerbot. The radio and clock internals are on a removable chassis held into the body by 2 screws, I decided to use this same basic idea for my Chumby mod because I didn't want to permanently modify the radio. The base plate is a piece of aluminum sheet and the various components are riveted in place. All the Chumby components are held in place with the screws that originally held them together. Problems/Future Plans: One of the knobs from the radio wasn't reused (under the screen), this might get made into a power button. The screen holder back plate had to be bend a bit to work. (I also didn't want to print another screen holder). Make a back cover. Make a cover to hide the gap around the screen. There was no other way to attach the screen, so the holder is hot glued onto the case, but this is easily removed. Some Chumby apps are no longer supported, a big example being Twitter. *I broke the microphone connector and may fix it and add this back later.",19539,Adam Minter

0,8913,"""Amiga"" Ball - Printable bicolor ball with a single-head printer","Hello Amiga fans ! (But maybe I am the only one here...) This is a new geeky realization : the famous red and white ball from the ""Amiga Boing Demo"" by Robert J. Mical (1984) (an original screen capture is present in the photos). I designed it to be printed with a single head printer. You can build it with NO GLUE like a small puzzle! Printing is simple, you just have to print all the parts two time in white and in red. (The center parts can be printed just one time but in the two different colors). If you are not a fan of Amiga, you can of course print the parts of the ball with different colors ;-) As it is a ""precision"" work, the printer must be properly adjusted so that the pieces stacks correctly in the end! If your printer is not very precise, I recommend to print the ball at 120% (1.2) of its size for greater accuracy during building. (On the pictures, the balls are at 100 and 120%). All parts can be printed without support except the No. 6 (amiga_ball_part06.stl) that is particularly difficult to print properly without support. (It's possible by rotating it at 180° but the result is not guaranteed ...) Amiga forever ! Thank you.",20207,LITHINES
0,8914,Big letters logo Blender + Blender guy,"Hello, This project is a test for making large letters like signs. It is possible to make larger letters of course but the idea was to create a ""big"" Blender logo for a desktop, a table or a presentation stand. The letters are empty with thin walls for not using a lot of PLA. Why do I choose the Blender logo ? Because I use it and that I find this software brilliantly cool. To animate the logo I have created a little character that one can put on the Blender logo (or anywhere else!) IMPORTANT: If you reduce the size of the letters be careful to the fine walls. You might have holes in the letters during printing! Everything can be printed without a raft or support but the character requires a little gluing. I hope you will enjoy it.

I have designed five models: 1 support in ""Death Star"" style entitled ""Starship"". 1 support that looks like a ground (foliage, snow, sand ...) entitled ""Rebels"". 1 support in Tie Fighter wings style entitled ""Empire"". 1 neutral support. 1 neutral larger support for some big figures. Under the support, I propose to put a sticker identifying the figure with the episode title. (PNG file attached in the thingivers photos). IMPORTANT : If you want to change the size of the support, enlarge or reduce it but not the small part that enters the feet of the figure. It is modelized at the exact size to enter in the hole of the feet without forcing too much. Can be printed without raft or support. 10% full is enough. Good collection... with style!

(But as it is relatively thin, it does not take much PLA). It can be printed without raft or support. WARNING: when assembling the wings, push gently but firmly. Be careful not to break them.

The pyramid will definitely be easier to print than the sphere. The base is 100mm or about 4 inches.

0,9069,Coral,"Nothing really original or creative in this piece, sorry… ;) I was just thinking, while playing with the sculpt mode in Blender, how much trying to design a shape that could be printed without any support kind of looks like the way coral grows under water, reaching for the surface, where the sunlight comes from. Additive 3D printing, even for different reasons, determines the same kind of process (going up, without ever starting on empty space). I was just making some silly blobs from half a sphere, and with that additive process in mind, I spontaneously made it grow like coral does. It reminded me of what world-famous comics artist Mœbius said about the process of drawing natural shapes : to draw a rock, or a tree, you have to become a rock, or a tree (and then branches, and leaves), in your mind. I guess I understood that better as, without really meaning to in the beginning, I somehow became a piece of coral, and started to grow up… :)",15208,Bruno Bellamy

Hello human, thank you for taking on the challenge of helping to rebuild the MakerTron population. Before you begin, there are a few things you should know about how the MakerTrons operate. Additionally, one kind human has created a video tutorial that explains how to properly design your MakerTron parts.
MakerTron C.O.R.E
The MakerTron C.O.R.E. (Centrally Operating Robotic Engine) is the key component of life for all MakerTron. While it may just look like a torso to you humans, it houses all the key components required to survive. Each MakerTron C.O.R.E acts as the heart, soul and brain and personality of a citizen, while processing data from, and controlling all of their other body parts. As long as a MakerTron is able to keep its C.O.R.E intact, it can survive and thrive with any combination of other body parts.
By attaching other body parts to the C.O.R.E, MakerTron citizens can become experts at certain tasks that are needed in daily life and to advance society as a whole. Each part has a specific role to play in the ability of the MakerTron citizen. You can see an example of a functional MakerTron by downloading the blueprints for my design. 
Head
The head adds the ability to see, speak, and listen, while also providing additional computing power to make the MakerTron smarter than if they didn’t have a head. With specific augmentations like excellent vision, translation skills, acute hearing and large amounts of computing power, certain MakerTron become experts in areas such as security, diplomacy and research.
Arms
Arms provide a way for the MakerTron to physically interact with and manipulate their environment. Balancing strength with dexterity and the ability to attach specific tools to their arms, a wide variety of jobs can be filled in depending on the the design of the arms. Large powerful arms may make for excellent builders and transporters, while narrow, nimble arms and fingers are helpful for engineers and artists. Additionally, directly attaching weapons, armour, or tools can help depending on their jobs.
Legs
A MakerTron is heavily dependent on it’s legs for mobility and transportation. Legs may be tall and lean for rescue missions, or short and sturdy for those carrying heavy loads, or they may be equipped with rockets to fly, wheels to cover long distances or other upgrades to swim, or fit into specific places.
Since all MakerTron parts are interchangeable and upgradeable, it’s easy to see how many possible combinations there are - infinite. Design your own upgrade today and help build a better tomorrow for all MakerTron kind.
Thank you for your help in rebuilding the MakerTron population, I am forever in your debt.

Simple design to allow hooking the lights over gazebo or tent structures, vertically or horizontally.  COB LEDs are super bright and illuminate amazingly with very low power consumption.

Hello human. I’m Remix of the MakerTron, a once proud and prolific species of friendly robots from the planet Kwota, and I desperately need your help.
I’m one of the last remaining MakerTron in the Universe after a huge supernova explosion destroyed Kwota and everyone on it.

I’ve travelled many light years to find intelligent life and now I’m counting on you. Please, help me rebuild the MakerTron population!
By the time our system detected the impending doom, we only had one hour to implement a contingency plan. I was informed by central intelligence that a cargo pod full of Centrally Operating Robot Engines (C.O.R.E.s) loaded with all the data on how to rebuild our species had been launched into a safe zone in space – then all communication went black.
I was able to recover these C.O.R.E.s, but my fuel supply was low, so I couldn’t stay and wait for others. As a basic technician, I don’t have the skills to design the parts needed to build more MakerTrons, but you do, which is why I need your help.
Will you help me rebuild the MakerTron population?

""Free trade is terrible. Free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people. But we have stupid people""
This design was based off the most awesome mock photo for Trump 2016 which is also attached with this item. Do not know who made it but am giving out credit for basis of idea. 
You can go to a craft software and get adhesive backed safety pins to make these full out campaign pins.
Some of these items are made in multiple parts and can be nested into each other. Based on the Circular back you print you can get different aspects of the logo.This is for if you do not have a multi head printer you can still get multiple colors. I also have a full joined piece for others that want a single print. If you really want the native files I can load these as well.
Hair and Main are items that can be nested into a circle if you want. I have both of these models to have ability to be nested into either circle to give positive or negative effect. If you are having clearance issues, try scaling in your software when doing individual pieces that nest in main circle, nesting pieces have tight clearances.

0,9136,Tom's Raspberry Pi Camera Mount V3 + (optional) LED Mount V1,"My first project in Fusion 360 (good bye SketchUp) is suitable for all owners of Raspberry Pi (with OctoPi, 3DPrinterOS etc.) which works as a remote control of their 3D printer. If you want to see printing job from computer, tablet or mobile – almost anywhere and anytime – you want to have a mount for your standard camera or Pi NoIR (infrared camera). And if you have infrared camera, you may also need IR LEDs mount (light for dark rooms). Both parts are connected by pieces of filament – see Instructions for more details.
What you need:
Raspberry Pi with original camera (standard or NoIR)
case with open GPIO slot (mount will use it as a base) 
working 3D printer (no supports needed) 
two short pieces of 1.75mm filament 
optional for printing in completely dark room: IR LEDs board like http://i.tvit.cz/PiIRLED (costs 4–5 $; you will use 12V power source for it)
Instructions: 
No supports needed. Layers max. 0.2mm are recommended.
If you have only Raspberry Pi camera, print only main part of mount. If you have IR LEDs, print both parts.
To connect parts: Use two short pieces of 1.75mm filament (cca 10mm). They need to be very tightly inserted to holes on both parts so there is no swinging. If your printer is not so precise (like my Printrbot), you will need to scrub all holes (mainly entry areas) for filament. If it doesn't help, take your sharp knife and rub the surface of filament pieces to required diameter. Do not cut it. It is easy and fast.",26275,Tom Vít

I'm going to lay out instructions on how to get the perfect fit for your spools in the instruction tab... You can also watch the YouTube video below where I explain everything you need to know... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zG1CFx9aUIk&feature=youtu.be There are three ""sizes"" (different length arms) for this spool holder... Every arm length is on this page in STL form, but to make it simpler and to avoid confusion, I made three separate pages for each sized holder (Small, Standard, Oversized)... When you watch the video or read the instructions you know what measurements to take to get the perfect fit... On a side note, if you want a truly, all around ""Universal"" holder - you can simply print two ""OverSized"" Arms and 110mm Rods... This will fit damn near every spool - it just wont be a tailored fit - and thus wont look pretty... This is why I decided to make three sizes - strictly for aesthetic reasons. Small - http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1001360 Standard - http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:943563 OverSized - http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1001359 This is a full redesign of my popular, but old and relatively weak spool holder that I designed nearly two years ago... Old, Obsolete Spool Holder: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:290064 This new design is 100% better - I completely redesigned my screws and spinner bolts for better tolerance for 3D Printing... My old screws were good if they were machined, but they were way too fine to be 3D printed well... So I made the threading much better and made the screws much stronger... I also added a lot of structural features that I explain in the video... Here's a list of what I did in the new design. Made both arms (the base and the spinner) 2.5mm shorter in height, I also added fillets to every corner so every contour is nice and rounded. Redid the bolt pattern and made that easier on the hand while spinning the spinner bolt. Increased the diameter of the screws and added 45 degree chamfers for strength... Screws are very strong now. Redid all the threading... This will thread smooth and tight right off the printer - I had 100% success rate on prints. Added a hole on the lower Rods to hold ends of filament to keep them from unraveling or raveling in - resulting in getting the spool tangled up. This is now about a 33% decrease in total print time from my old design... Overall, it should take about 6-7 hours to print an entire holder on a standard .2mm layer setting... But you can speed it up by going .3mm and everything will be perfect... Infill is not a big issue... 15-20% should do it... If you want everything to look nice on the outside - do 3 perimeter shells. Other than all of that - this should work for everyone and will fit on 95% of spools... The only spool I know doesn't fit on this univeral holder is Taulman brand spools... But never fear, I made a spool holder specifically for Taulman Spools... You can find the Taulman spool holder here... http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:938437 **I hope you find this spool holder useful... Thanks for reading... ENJOY!!! FilamentChallenge",15795,JJPowelly

0,9154,Zheng's GoPro Gubbinses,"A month ago the gadget stork dropped off a shiny new GoPro Hero3+ at Zheng Labs' Shipping and Recieving South entrance. Ostensibly it was to be used for time lapse photography, but while the dwarves were setting up tripods and lighting in The Forge, my son strapped the camera to his head and took it down the water slide.   We took advantage of this delay (that kid won't get out of the water until his lips are blue) to craft a few GoPro accessories.   First: a tripod plate compatible with the excellent entry-level EXPLORERV Vista Explorer Tripod. This plate has a dovetailed slot so that you can swap out either an (included) GoPro case mounting stub or, and this was a feature request direct from the dwarven foreman at The Forge, a mounting stub that's compatible with 1/2"" EMT electrical conduit.   Now you can put your GoPro on a tripod and, using the conduit as an extension, get really close to the action.   (The creation of 10' conduit selfie sticks is left as an exercise for the adventurous reader.)   But here's the thing: The GoPro is a great little camera, but it's only got a 2.5 hour battery life. If you're doing an extended 3D printing timelapse, you've got to keep it charged via USB. Barring some accident of quantum superpositon there's no way you're getting a mini-USB plug through the side of the waterproof case.   So we hammered together a naked GoPro mounting bracket, too, and included conduit and tripod-plate variations thereof.   A thumbscrew and nut combination keeps the conduit in place. You'll want to super glue the nut into the mounting stubs before inserting the conduit.",10770,zheng3

Bulbasaur's Red, Blue, & Green artwork.
Bulbasaur resembles a small, squatting dinosaur that walks on four legs and has a large bulb on its back that is able to shoot seeds out of. It also has large red eyes and has very sharp teeth. Its skin is a light turquoise color with dark green spots. It has three claws on all its four legs. Its most notable feature, however, is the aforementioned bulb on its back, which as the Pokédex states, was planted on it at birth.
Abilities
Bulbasaurs have ""bulbs"" on their backs that grow steadily larger as the Bulbasaur matures. This bulb contains a seed which uses photosynthesis to supply Bulbasaur with energy. Its bulb is also used to store the energy which the seed absorbs, which can be used when it is necessary. It is assumed that when a Bulbasaur collects enough energy in its bulb, it will evolve into an Ivysaur.
Behavior
Bulbasaur is very polite Pokémon. They are very loyal to their trainer and always try their best to win the battle for them.
Habitat
As Bulbasaur is a starter Pokémon, it is hard to locate, however, it could be found near streams.
Evolution
Bulbasaur evolves into Ivysaur at level 16 and then Venusaur at level 32.",19209,董彬文

The spool fits in the curve of the object which helps it spin easily and feed the printer without getting stuck. This print should print well, though it may take a while.

Artwork of Charmander for Pokémon Red and Blue
Charmander is a small, bipedal, dinosaur-like Pokémon. Most of its body is colored orange, while its underbelly is a light yellow color. Charmander, along with all of its evolved forms, has a flame that is constantly burning on the end of their tails.
Abilities
Charmander has the ability Blaze, which allows their Fire-type attacks to cause 150% more damage if their health drops below 30%.
As a natural ability, Charmander can produce flames inside of itself and project them from its mouth, meaning that it can breathe fire. The power of its flame attacks can be gauged by the size of the flame on its tail.
Behavior
Charmander is easily the most mild-mannered and well- behaved of it's evolution line. It's feelings and emotions can be read by the flame on the tip of it's tail. If it grows that means it's angry or is about to attack.
Habitat
Charmander is rarely found in the wild since it's a starter Pokemon. Sometimes they gather in extremely hot areas such as active volcanoes or in craggy mountains and in caves along the coast of the Sevii Islands.
Gender differences Evolution
Charmander evolves into Charmeleon once it reaches level 16. Charmander's final evolution is Charizard which it evolves into at Level 36.",19209,董彬文

Squirtle is a small, light-blue Pokémon with an appearance similar to that of a turtle. Like turtles, Squirtle has a shell that covers its body with holes that allow its limbs, tail, and head to be exposed. Unlike a turtle, Squirtle is ordinarily bipedal.
Special abilities
Squirtle has the ability Torrent, which boosts the power of its water type attacks by 150%, if its health drops to 33% or below.
Squirtle also has the natural ability to shoot water from its mouth, which is where the bulk of its attacks comes from. In order to defend itself from physical attacks, Squirtle hides itself in its shell.
Evolution
Squirtle evolves into Wartortle at level 16 and again at level 36 into Blastoise.

Squirtle is a starter option in Pokémon Red, Blue, Green, FireRed and LeafGreen. A Squirtle can also be received as a gift in Yellow.

The Dress Minder has the ability to track the day of the week, month, and date along with the days worn. My Acetone smoothing may have reduced the readability of the words. It says ""Dress Mind"" at the top and then ""Days Worn"" at the bottom. I would print the date wheels and rod separately, then the day of the week, month and days worn with supports.

0,9206,Safety Cone Caution Tape Attachment,"The inspiration of this device comes from ten years of working in the security industry. Some clients were too cheap to buy the long pole type of safety devices designed for caution tape. Officers would use regular 18 inch tall safety cones instead to block off parking areas or around safety hazards like construction holes. Struggling to attempt to tie the caution tape through and around a full cone, or attempting to attach to the cones using packing tape was difficult to perform. Tying it looked rather tacky and the tape either would not stick because the cones were too dirty or would stick so well we couldn’t get it off when we were done. Suggest printing at least 30% infill at .2mm layer height with supports. Device screws into the top of a safety cone with a 1 1/4 inch top hole. The quality of the cone top is important for the device to screw in effectively. Probably not the best design for cones that have been highly used and constantly stacked on a pole as the wear will result in much larger holes. Also, you should not stack a cone on top of others with the device in place. The hole originally was so that it would not suction cup to the other cones, so plugging it will negate the effect and make it difficult to pull the cone off others. Has been designed to allow attachment of a bicycle style blinker light (the back one from Bell is pictured here). Caution tape can be placed into the hook and either tied directly to it or wrapped so it can be used as middle holder.",19977,Pierrimus
0,9207,No Signs,"These signs were originally inspired by a visit by someone trying to get me to switch my propane company, thus they started with the No Soliciting sign, then I made up the Do Not Disturb and No Trespassing. Living in an Apartment, I couldn't just slap a regular sign on my door without damaging their door. So these were designed with the ability to zip tie them to the door knocker, or you could hang them on the door knob, and even daisy chain them together. Of course, you can also just screw them in if you don't mind the damage. The No Trespassing would also be nice to post on the door of a gate. I would print them in ABS since you want them to survive hot days. You could pause on height at 2 mm and change filament colors rather than painting them like I did. ",19977,Pierrimus

Even 12$ if you already have a hercule HD twist. I think we can say it's ""the cheaper 3d scaner on earth"" you just need a arduino nano, 1 to 4 line laser and a micro geared stepper (28BYJ-48) (see instruction for BOM) no external power needed. just 2 free usb port on your pc : one for the webcam the other for the rest. UPDATE I’m proud to announce you the release of the open source Software for the “cheapest 3d scanner on earth” the 30$ DIY Sardauscan. The software Is written in C# and allow you to compose your Scan task by drag and drop. Recommended Process is composed from these scan “Scan” => “IrQ filter” => “merge laser” (if you use more than one laser) => “Build Mesh by interpolation “ => “Save STL”. But if you are not satisfied with the build-in processing task, or if you prefer use another heavy but powerful software to work with your point clouds like meslab or other, you can just “Scan” => “Save Ply” and import them in your preferred application. While the software come with a building support of the Sardauscan hardware, and usb camera. You can easely write your own Hardware proxy via plugins. You can event build your own task to insert in your scan process.

The graphic above is courtesy of http://www.livescience.com/32559-why-do-we-see-in-color.html The science of light is critical to research in eye health. Even the Mantis Shrimp gets to take part. http://www.gizmag.com/mantis-shrimp-eyes-cancer-camera/34049/ I think social science is also a key category in this build. The art and history of Chinese Calligraphy is amazing and very fun to learn about. http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/special/china_1000bce_calligraphy.htm Update 7/15/15 I have added a V2 of the base that is rounder and may be a little easier for some to print. If you print the base at 10% infill it is strong enough and floats well. It is better to have 3 perimeters to make sure that it is watertight.,26051,toby_lankford

0,9387,Modelstudy Ravijn Fly-Over in Nijverdal,"Unieke samenwerking in NijverValley. Nijverdal 29-03-2014 Overeenkomst Volgende week dinsdag tekenen Nijverdal ten Kate (leverancier van hoogwaardige gewapende thermoplasten) en Hegemann Betonbouw (bouwonderneming die gebruik maakt van speciale gewapende betonconstructies) een samenwerkingsovereenkomst om in de toekomst intensiever met elkaar te werken. Beide bedrijven vullen elkaar aardig aan op het gebied van lichtgewicht constructies. Nijverdal Ten Kate met gewapende thermoplastische composiet materialen die veelvuldig gebruikt worden in de luchtvaart industrie en de laatste jaren steeds meer in de automotive industrie. Deze materialen lijken nu uitermate geschikt voor extreem sterke en lichtgewicht brugdelen. Hegemann Betonbouw heeft veel ervaring met gecompliceerde hoog belaste betonnen bruggen. Ravijn-Fly-Over Als pilot project wordt de nieuw te maken Ravijn-Fly-Over genoemd, een fiets-voetbrug over de nieuwe N35 en de spoorlijn in het Ravijn. Deze brug maakt deel uit van de Fietssnelweg F35 die loopt van Enschede, Hengelo, Almelo en Wierden naar het bezoekerscentrum boven op de berg in Nijverdal. Delen van deze F35 zijn al zichtbaar bij het Nijverdalse station. Ook verbind deze Ravijn-Fly-Over het bezoekerscentrum op de Sallandse berg met het Avonturenpark en het Landalpark in Hellendoorn. Lange afstand wandelaars (gebruikers van het Pieterpad) kunnen ook van deze brug, met een adembenemend uitzicht, gebruik maken. Unieke constructie De fiets-voetbrug krijgt een lengte van 150 meter en bestaat uit 7 dragende pylonen waarvan de langste 18 meter boven het Ravijn uitsteekt. Op deze pylonen komen 6 zelfdragende brugdelen die elk een lengte hebben van 20 meter. De brugdelen uit versterkt thermoplast zijn 6 meter breed (4 meter voor de Fietssnelweg F35 en 1,5 meter voor het voetpad). Daar waar de brugdelen op de betonnen pylonen liggen ontstaat een rond uitzichtpunt van 12 meter met overkapping om te genieten van het prachtige uitzicht. Ook kan hier een bank geplaatst worden. De brugdelen hebben kabelkanalen voor verlichting en regenwaterafvoer onder het voetgangers deel. Unieke samenwerking Niet alleen deze bedrijven uit Nijverdal zijn betrokken, ook de Gemeente Hellendoorn, de Provincie Overijssel , de Regio Twente en de Fietsersbond spelen een belangrijke rol.",27104,tunnelplan

What are bubbles? 
Bubbles are created when an air pocket is trapped inside of film from a soapy sphere. 
Why are they only spheres? 
Even though many of the bubble wands are different shapes, bubbles can only form in a sphere because they are ""minimal surface structures"", which means that they shrink to the smallest shape they can be for the volume of air it holds. 
Why do they pop? 
Aside from landing on something pokey, they pop because the water between the soap films evaporates from the sun. That's why when it's colder, bubbles tend to last longer because of the slowed evaporation process and sometimes will freeze. 
Why do bubbles stick together? 
Bubbles want to have the smallest surface area it can possibly have, so it will share a common wall with another bubble. If there are three bubbles that join together, they will meet at the center at a 120 degree angle! 
Where do bubbles get their colors? 
Bubbles get their colors from light waves reflecting between the soap film’s outer and inner surfaces. The distance between the layers gets smaller as the water evaporates, making the colors change.

0,9420,"LED Sticks: A Modular, Low Power, LED Light System for 3D Printe","As someone who prints a lot, and who rarely sleeps, I would always find myself using my cell phone light to look at my prints while working through the night. I was so tired of it I designed a basic LED driver that operates from a wall outlet, to provide visible light while printing. As my designs kept evolving I finally settle on having a main driver unit(shown clipped onto the top left, printed in brown) with multiple clip-on LED ""sticks"" which you can stick on any edge of 3D printers. I had my circuit fabricated, and began prototyping. The current design can feature up to 8 Modular LED sticks, with just the change of a small resistor. I used bendable cables for wiring up the LEDs, and then covered them with clear cable protectors to ensure they could take a beating, as well as look stylish. As you'll see these are not your typical LEDs, but LEDs used for back-lighting and aesthetic design purposes. I will have a link soon to provide where I purchased them. As you'll see in the pictures, I used kapton tape to secure the LED onto the stick itself. This method allows the user to use any type of colored tape to get the light tone they want. Kapton tape is semi-orange and gives off a ""warm"" white versus a bright white. I used BSI gap-filler to secure the wire leads onto the stick, for a firm super glue like hold. Using a caliper, I was able to make precise measurements to make sure that the clips will not interfere with the printing process. So far there are no problems! The LED driver PCB is shown as the last picture with a basic description, please let me know if you have questions, I am planning on posting the schematic and parts list soon. Last but not least, you'll find 3 .stl files provided. The driver case, and two different LED Stick sizes, regular and ""Jumbo."" They are very basic and easy designs for quick printing and use.

The planter is a small deep dish in which you can easily plant any small spice plant or flower. For example, our picture features a mint plant, which we use for tea :) The utensil holder was designed keeping a wide range of tools in thought, we have it displayed with a wooden spoon and a set of tongs. The towel holders speak for themselves as adding a few of them will keep them dry and out of that dirty sink!

The result of this request was this design.  The mounting leaves fold together to take less space in your gig bag and are sized to take an iPad 1-4.  It is again totally 3D printed with no screws needed, just a strip of foam rubber needed to be glued into the mounting aperture. I will be producing a range of accessories for the same mounting in the coming months.  I recommend printing the load-bearing parts as solidly as possible and making sure that everything is tight so it doesn't flop about when you're using it.  The aperture is again sized to fit a standard 15mm mic-stand boom, if anyone needs a custom size please contact me and we can discuss adapting it to your needs.",27248,EnterpriseXD

0,9648,floating scale 3 in 1,"The idea: for the science challenge I wanted to design something that demonstrates the principle of buoyancy, displacement and density. Density is calculated by dividing mass by volume so both have to be measured. Volume is measured by the displacement of water in a container and mass by means of buoyancy. Additionally I wanted to show the comparison between to objects with different densities but same mass in the way Archimedes did it. The design: -measure volume: A cylinder is filled about half with water and the level marked. Then coins are tossed in and the water rises. The difference in height equals to the volume of the coins divided by the surface area of the water. If the surface area is 1000mm^2, the water will rise 1mm for every cm^3 of coin volume. To get this area the radius of the cylinder has to be the square root of 1000mm^2/pi = 17.84mm. -measure weight: the cylinder has an outside radius of 25.23mm and an area of 2000mm^2 so it will sink 1mm for every 2g. This can be measured with the outer part that floats. -compare density on each side of the scale the same amount of weight is placed but on one side the material is denser than on the other. Then the scale is immersed in water where the less dense material displaces more water and this side of the scale rises. The test: for testing I used 50c coins which weigh 7.8g and have a density of 8.54 g/cm^3 and a silver coin which weighs an ounce (31.1g) and has a density of 10.49 g/cm^3.",27246,ChriZ3D

0,9699,Fully 3D Printable RC Vehicle (Improved from previously posted),"The vehicle I have designed was inspired by the OPENRC Project. I wanted to make it, but I wanted much more simplicity in the mechanics. I had a few DJI phantom brushless motors and various other aerial RC hardware laying around. I decided to go with these parts because I have never seen it done before. Drivetrain: The motors are built into the rear wheels, Eliminating Shafts, gearing, belts, and other costly linkages. The Result is a crazy fast, relatively high torque vehicle. (I am afraid to go full throttle as I have a relatively small place to drive my rc car.) The ESCs( Motor Controllers) should be identical. I used different ones (one that is Simon K and one that isn't) and I got more torque from the non-Simon K ESC. Steering and Front End: The steering uses two 9g servos that simply are part of the Top A-arm. When the servo is able to move with the suspension, it eliminates the need for a complicated linkage system. Wheels: I should say, all of the wheels that you will need for this vehicle will need to be custom made. I designed and printed a road set and an off-road set. I doubt the wheels I used will fit anybody's tires. I tried to make the wheel versatility as easy to adapt as possible. For the Front wheels, a skateboard bearing was used for the wheel to freely rotate around. The rear wheels use the motor of your choice, therefore, the inner wheel diameter will differ with whatever motor is being used. The Printed parts: I recommend using a high density infill when printing your version(if you decide to do so). I used 20% infill with PLA and a crash destroyed every part in early development. I used PLA for every printed part of the car, however, I wanted to use ABS, but I just cannot keep ABS on my heated bed. Any transmitter should be suitable, just make sure that your servos are correctly mixed together to move in sync. Building: I included Screenshots as well as the assembly files from my CAD software to help on the assembly process. If there are any questions regarding assembly, feel free to leave a comment and I will do my best to help you. ENJOY! https://youtu.be/yQFBOyBylDg",27586,cmpercle97@gmail.com

0,9701,3-D Printable RC Car,"This RC Car was Designed to workaround the need for expensive rc car motors and intricate linkages. When I saw the Open RC truggy, I wanted one, but didn't want to also buy all of the Rc car part needed just to get it working. I used parts that any typical maker may hopefully have. The 9 gram steering servos are mounted to the top a-arms to take away the need for ball joints and a large amount of linkages. For the motor...motors, I recycled my DJI Phantom brushless motors. instead of using any gearing, I simplified the design by making them part of the rear wheels. This creates a great amount of speed while still having a surprising mount of torque. I used a hobby grade rc plane radio and power the car using two 3s lipo batteries. The fasteners vary from m3 nuts and bolts to plastic screws I was able to salvage. The front wheels rotate around a general skateboard bearing. I want to see what others are able to do with this platform. Hopefully improvements will come forth, making the vehicle a reliable open source machine. https://youtu.be/eop02s6c_rk https://youtu.be/3nNnf1uNtOQ",27586,cmpercle97@gmail.com

Suicune from Pokémon Adventures
Suicune is sky blue in color, with white rhombuses around the body and a white belly. Suicune has an aquamarine crest on its head which is in the shape of a hexagram. Behind its crest is a purple mane with supposedly thick, smooth fur. Two white, ribbon-like tails sprout out from Suicune's back and constantly flow forward. A shiny Suicune is light periwinkle, with a darker periwinkle crest and a cerulean colored mane.
Evolution
This Pokémon does not evolve.
Game info
In Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, Suicune roams around Kanto if the player character's Starter Pokémon was Charmander and they have beaten the Elite Four. In FireRed and LeafGreen, it is very hard to catch because it will flee unless your send out a Pokémon that has the ability Shadow Tag or the move It appears at Level 50.
In Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, It roams on Johto and Kanto. Once catching up to it, it appears at Level 40 at both Route 25 and the Burned Tower.",19209,董彬文
0,9705,LiBu Mini Laser Engraver,"Description
Hi!
We proudly present, LiBu, your little burner. This 3D printed structure's objective is to bring an universal option for those who want to build it's own mini laser engraver, using old CD/DVD units scavenged from old computers, using it's stepper plates.
The idea is to biuld the machine using the printed parts as a structure, only adding some M3 screws and nuts (only M3 everywhere).
The axis are thought to be kind of adjustablein height and width to fit as CD/DVD plate models as possible.
The whole thing can be set up with an Arduino Nano, 2 stepper drivers, a 250+ mW laser and a pertinent driver, this will allow you to engrave wood and plastic, and cut paper and foam.
The firmware I recommend is Grbl, which is the most standard and open that I know. There are thousands of websites where you can learn how to extract and use the laser from the CD/DVD unit and use it (this project was deeply inspired by them), like:
http://www.instructables.com/id/Pocket-laser-engraver/ or http://www.instructables.com/id/Disassembling-a-CDDVD-reader-and-reusing-its-parts/ or
http://www.instructables.com/id/Frankenstein-Laser-Engraver/
but there are many many others :)
And there also some other sites where you could buy the whole laser unit (diode + driver), like Odic force. There's ebay, alibaba etc.
WARNING!!!
REMEMBER THAT A LASER MAY SERIOUSLY AND DEFINITIVE HARM YOUR EYES, DO NOT EVEN START THE LASER PARTS IF YOU DIDN'T GOT A GOOD PAIR OF GOOGLES, AND REMEMBER THAT THEY HAVE TO BE SPECIAL FOR YOUR LASER COLOR (WAVELENGTH). BEWARE THE IR LASERS, YOU CANNOT SEE THEM BUT THEY'RE AS HARMFUL AS THE OTHER TYPES.",27596,meyo

0,9875,Hard Drive Platter coaster,"I had a collection of hard drive platters piling up.  Who doesn't? Each one is a highly polished aluminum mirror. I thought that there must be a 3D printed use for them. So I fired up 123D Design and made 2 different drink coaster/display bases. One based on a cylinder, with straight walls, and the other based on a torus, with curved walls.
Liberate a few hard drive platters from some obsolete or defective 3.5 inch hard drives. You'll need some very small Torx bits. Look under the labels for hidden screws.
All the platters seem to be the same 95mm in diameter. Some are slightly thicker than others but that doesn't matter here. The 2 designs should allow the platter to snap in place with a small bit of room for printer variations. If you find them too tight or loose, play with the X and Y dimensions in your slicer a bit. Multiply by 1.005 and see where that takes it. Be sure to multiply both X and  Y by the same amount or you'll end up with an oval that won't fit anything. Don't ask me how I know this.
If using for a drink coaster, I'd recommend spreading a small layer of silicone around the edges of the interior before you put the platter in place. Leave the center of the base clear of silicone so it doesn't show.That should keep liquid from migrating under the platter.
I started out printing them all black, then experimented with changing the filament color about halfway through the print. At .3mm layer height, there were 22 layers, so I changed at layer 11 or 12.
I printed them with .3mm layer height in PLA at 50mm speed with 15% infill.",16490,Gary Fischer

I went with the original designs from the cartoon. Sure, the new version is pretty sweet looking but the old versions are just nostalgic. After the swords are printed and put together, they are about 27 inches long. Photos were taken when the pieces were not glued together yet. The She-Ra sword had very little warping.

0,10618,Statue of Liberty - Repaired,"Note - the picture is of the same statue not sliced.

Please read instructions on how to assemble. Check out all the pics! The amazing Statue of Liberty from New York! Amaze friends, family, teachers, and even pets with this awesome replica. 
 Summary: The Statue of Liberty was an incredibly complex project for a young amateur like me. I used google maps and earth files, and also a replica of a statue of liberty that I have. However, my little replica was missing an arm that broke off, so the scan was not complete. I spent long hours combining many scans and drawing parts of the model to reach the final product, but the print would fail as one piece. After lots of dedication to cleaning up the stl file and then slicing the model into stable pieces, I came up with an incredible detailed, realistic and awesome model of the statue of liberty. Enjoy. Read on to learn more! 
THE STRUCTURE : The statue of liberty is an extraordinary structure that I visited a few years back. It is an internationally famous landmarks, which can take people's breath away. Since I began learning how to 3D print in school, I always have had a dream of making the statue of liberty. It is incredible complex and time consuming because of all the folds and intricate details, but thats what makes it so outstanding. It would not have been possible without multiple 3d Scans. THE PROBLEM : How should I make it? I tried drawing the structure with freehand, but that failed. Instead, I used a google earth model and multiple scans of a Statue of Liberty replica I have to make one ultra realistic model. No more problems right?.... but of course there was one big problem... there are objects hanging of the statue over thin air, such as the hand! Solution : After many failed attempts of trying to remove the hands and print them separately, I realized that I could slice the model. I am still an amateur, and I had never heard about slicing before, but after a few tries, I came up with this present model. It is very stable with a flat bottom but STILL REQUIRES SUPPORTS for the suspended objects such as the book. Read the instructions and print for best results.",27524,dodo2000

I made a rectangular prism base, then I made a thin rectangle floating on top of prism, after that I connected everything with lines to assemble the main body. There is an open part on the roof in a rectangle shape as you can see, which would be completely open in real life but I partially filled it for stability.

0,10622,Sydney Opera House,"The Sydney Opera House spectral structure I visited while with my cousins. It takes your breath away from a distance, but is even more magnificent when your visit it. It is hard to imagine how some architect visualized such an abstract structure, and even hard to think how it was built. It has a very original and creative design, and I wanted to capture it. It is one of the most amazing man made marvels of the world, and I am excited to present this model. Printed on a prusa i3 Einstein from ""Marko's Hub"" check out skp images of my new work in progress prototype. The curves of the roof tops had to be developed in a creative way, as the were taken as slices of an oval sphere, and matched to the shape of the actual opera house. I tool my pieces and compared it to an existing google earth model. The google earth model itself could not be used because it had too many internal structures and hidden geometry, and printing it failed, so I had to design my own model. The rest of the model model was quite difficult to construct. Originally, it though I could just connect the rooftops and make one solid model, but I was so wrong. I forgot the pieces in between and the one solid model also failed. Therefore, I had to copy the roof and make another shell, so now the roof actually had thickness and could print instead of just being lines. Then I tried to make the base of the structure as the original Sydney Opera House, but that failed. I have temporarily just used a circle as a base because other people in who have made an opera house model did so too, but am working on a more realistic base for the structure. Through this experience I have learned a lot about 3D modelling and new softwares, not to mention numerous new techniques. I hope you enjoy my adaptation of the Sydney Opera House, and watch out for updates in the future.",27524,dodo2000

0,10632,St. Basil's Cathedral,"Remember to LAY FLAT and ON PLATFORM when printing. Use the highest resolution on your printer, and scale the size to as large as possible for best results. I had it printed from Marko's Hub in 3D hubs, with a Prusa i3 Einstein. St. Basil's Cathedral is a famous church in Moscow, Russia. Although I have never visited myself, I encountered it during a school project. Just looking at its mighty presence captivates you for a few seconds, because it is so bold and beautiful. The building has a very unique design that is the shape of a bonfire flame. I thought it would be a creative entry foe this contest because the building is so outstanding but not as well known, and when printed it pushes the limits of modern 3D printing to create something breath taking.The model I have uploaded is highly detailed and captures the essence of the Cathedral, and I hope you enjoy it. Designing this model proved to be extremely difficult. When I first sent the model for 3D printing, Marko's hub pointed out there were many errors. The first model I used was an open source file sketchup warehouse, (and that skethup model was from google Earth), but it had many flaws. I had to erase most of the models exterior and fix those pieces, but there was always problems being pointed out when I run it through Netfabb basic. Eventually the arches were removed, and also a lot of the internal geometry so the design is now solid. There were also invisible vertical structures inside the building obstructing the print, and those where a nightmare to remove. Although I failed when making this design many times, I still persevered to reach this stage. The final draft had one or two issues that hub fixed, and now you can have a realistic replica of the St. Basil's Cathedral in your home. Enjoy! Please leave a comment, about how the print went for you. Thanks!",27524,dodo2000

The arms - incredibly strong, with the strength to bend girders, an important feature when looking to rebuild a lost civilization.  The hands are nimble enough to lift wallets off of people, sometimes without them noticing.  The telescoping arms give this MakerTron access to all the hard-to-reach places others might hide their valuables. The legs - fast enough to run from the police, and sometimes get away.  They are also built quite strong, able to kick and break an orphan's crutch with ease.  The legs also telescope and, in combination with the telescoping action of the arms, allow the Makerton to cross all manner of rough terrain, even cross large ravines with ease.",28414,RymanBC

(fan holder fits for 50x50 or 40x40mm fan!) I am actually trying to make it more compact - hope to get the hardware work soon ;-)",28900,janosch

bowden extruder for 1,75mm & 3mm filament - can be used for all filament-diameters. the housing is a symmetric set-up for mounting the motor from both sides of the housing with an additional bearing placed in the housing at the end of the motor axis the guide for the filament is a separate part which is pivoted in the housing in such a way, that it can adjust to different filament diameters the housing is mounted to a plate with T-nut filament gear: MK8 filament gear ; bearing size: 5 x 13 x 4 (di = 5mm, da = 13mm, B=4mm)
Actually building is in process..... result will come soon + video on youtube. IMPORTANT information: I have the possibility to print the parts at LS-Medcap (belongs to a federation of medical companies in the south of germany, I am actually working as an engineer in development). We are using the printer in-House for development and I can use the printer any time. But this will - of course, sorry! - not be free in costs. I have to calculate the costs for printer + material - soon I will make a small calculation for 1. plastic parts and 2. a complete extruder with motor & all components. Will there be anybody interested in getting one......?? Printing more than 1 at the same time will reduce the costs. Please write me a mail, and I will collect the number of ""interested people"" for that. I will make a calculation afterwards and give you the price as an offer and you can decide if you want one or not. In that way, there will be no risk for you, but a chance to achive low costs for an extruder in really high quality.... much better than doing it with FDM- printers !!!

with alignment-setting of the j-head in z for easy adjusting of zero position in z ""standard"" wade´s extruder can be used! what you need: x-carriage + wade´s extruder + parts for bowden-Extruder (I am actually developping) + PTFE-sleeve (Di=2mm, Da=4mm) Further information will come soon - I am actually building a prototype. Ready at last: I tested function on 11.07.2014 - great! The asjustment of the z-end-stop is good... but the adjustment of the extruder-z-position is much better. Printing brim and skirt at the beginning of a print, you can adjust the height while moving x- and y-axis and printing! So you can adjust the optimal z-position for the first layer on bed (0,1mm is no problem as I tried!) The first testprint was really great, cause printing first layer is no problem anymore - the first layer was perfect fixed to the bed and I did not need extra prints to adjust the correct height at the beginning of printing! I will post a youtube video soon for that! If someone is interested for the metal-parts or the complete unit (for correct function you will need metal-parts as shown in the given stl-file on thingiverse - I made some small changes to the showed files here for correct function (I did not make actual drafts for that) - please send me a e-mail for your interest to: jan.maier@autorobotics.de. If I get a higher number of requests (perhaps >50...100, I have to check that with possible suppliers), if there is enough interest, I could do a calculation of the price/unit.

The welding arm can be attached so the Maker-bot can weld objects together as it builds. Any Maker-tron can equip these parts to build anything they desire.
For best printing results: Use supports for all pieces, print legs upright, prints arms lying down, print head at an angle laying backwards. The legs can have less fill %, more is suggested for the arms due to the cable and the claws, as well as the head since the neck is thin in areas.

Wall customizer; simply a piece that is allows the user to change the angle of the ends of the wall mold piece. To use simply slide it into the correct position facing forward on the wall mold piece, to stores simply flip it around and place it in the slot directly behind the front slot. Hand Scooper; this piece is basically a shovel in claw form, this allows the user to dig easily into the sand to get to the correct sand that is meant to be used when building sand castles Multi purpose carving tool; it is a multiple function tool that allows carving of the sandcastle, very small for percision details. round wall mold; very similar to the first item but is round and does not have interchangable wall angles all wall molds are 6 inches in height the multi purpose carving tool is 3 inches in height this a ready to go sand castle building kit, enjoy.

Can be used as 1- a passive mute (seal all the holes at the bottom to the outside apart from the pipe output). 2- Electronic mute, place a condenser microphone at top, put a small amplifier circuit inside and a voltage boost circuit for converting 1.5V dc to the required voltage for the amplifier. here is my voltage converter http://www.ebay.com/itm/DC-DC-Boost-Converter-Step-Up-Module-1-5V-to-5V-500mA-for-phone-MP4-MP3-Arduino-/351390823155?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item51d08672f3 I've ordered these but not tested yet for the microphone amplification http://www.ebay.com/itm/1pcs-Microphone-MIC-amplifier-module-Voice-Module-NEW-/201226168458?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item2eda03a88a I've made a prototype with the circuit schematic above. It works, but could be better. For obtaining a proper reducement in the sound passing thru the mute, all holes must be sealed from inside with something like a glue etc. Only the pipe output should stay open. If you have recommendations about the project, circuit schematics etc., post comments please.",29192,Özkal_Özsoy

0,10899,Digger Arm for the Robot tank toy project.,"Made this digging mechanism for my robot tank toy project(http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:687676). With this addition the robot platform can be used as nice construction toy for kids. Motors can also be added and the whole thing can also be used as a remote-self controlled digging robot. I've used the image gallery of the project by tc_fea to create the model (Thanks buddy, http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:32394). I didn't download or use the STL files at his project as they wouldn't be the right size for my toy robot and i wanted to make a bit stronger digger, so I've used the mechanism but the size and details of the model are different. Simulated it on solidworks, it works smoothly. http://youtu.be/ZjZ2-6sR_xY",29192,Özkal_Özsoy
0,10900,Ghost Busters' PKE Meter,"As the name implies, here is a PKE METER design similar to the one in the movie; Ghost Busters. Print this and use it to complete your ghost busters prop set or costume. Being a designer, I've improved the design a bit, so this PKE meter is not %100 same with the one in the movie, a bit smaller to fit smaller printers, better buttons and minor changes at the details. Internals should be quite different as i've never seen the inside of the original. :D I've cut the big body parts in two to fit in smaller printers. Also added internal details to screw them back to each other after printing. A bit of epoxy glue should also be fine. I managed to print this on my UP printer and glued them with epoxy. I've used the internal screws to secure parts together while glue sets, later removed them. Have fun. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuBJWYZohTs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwNLYC2PqbE",29192,Özkal_Özsoy
0,10901,Motorized Tank & Robot Chassis & Toy,"This design is a bit modular. It can be mobile robot chassis mechanical tank toy (no motors) motored tank toy mechanical buldozer motored buldozer. The [optional] tank palette is either a standard 7-8 speed bicycle chain or an o-ring of suitable size stretched to two wheels on one side. One o-ring for each wheel can also be used. The chassis is designed for the dimensions of geared DC mini motors which can be purchased from many sources. If it is going to be built as a pure mechanical toy, then the supplied extra axle parts can be built and used to fill places of the motors. There is a mechanism at the center of the chasis that enables us to tighten the chain without using an extra jockey wheel, by lengthening and shortening the entire chasis by turning a single screw. If you plan to build the wheels version then you might just glue the parts together. Or wrap two rubber bands around the chassis to keep parts together. the wheels are supplied in six different versions. One type is suitable for free rotation over the non motorized axles. And the other type is for being fixed to gear motor's shaft. And it can be tightened by a screw on it. Both of these are supplied in either tank palette, rubber ring or normal wheel versions which doesn'require a bicycle chain to be installed around them. Comments are welcome. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfrQwK_K7No&feature=youtu.be",29192,Özkal_Özsoy
0,10902,Dummy Security Camera,"I've searched thingiverse for a dummy security camera to place in front of my apartment, didn't be able to find a good one. So designed my own. The camera lens inside is actually a wide angle LED lens which is available on the market. Even without it the cam will look very real. There are 4 holes for 3mm leds that will imitate IR lighting leds inside the cameras. There is empty space inside so if you like you can place a circuit to flash them, or anyhting else. Even a real camera can be fitted in, making my design not a dummy but a real security cam. Ebay is full of small cameras, many of them wireless that can fit inside. There is also a dummy wireless antenna thing on top. Added an extra part designed by Cooasty for making the cam a little bit more manouvreable. Thanks Cooasty.",29192,Özkal_Özsoy

The air path gets wider all the way from the mouthpiece to the bell as it should in a cornet (excluding the valveblock area ). The mouthpiece is a 5B, as close as possible model of a well known cornet mouthpiece with wonderful sound. All parts are made or divided into smaller units, enabling this to be printed by using almost any printer, small or large. As usual I guess it will be a challenge to have the valves operate properly. http://youtu.be/1VWtdD2iAUE Have fun and happy printing.",29192,Özkal_Özsoy

All valve slides move in addition to bellbow and main tuning slide to tune the instrument in case it is out of tune. Modeling time 4 days.

0,10988,PRUSA I3 POWER SUPPLY MUFFLER.,"I own two of these printers and their located in my bedroom. And most of my prints are greater than 3 or 4 hours and happen at night. The way they are situated on a desk at the foot of my bed, the fans on the two can be quite loud being that they are facing right at me. So I had seen on here that someone else had did the same thing, but for another type of power supply. So here is is based on sound canceling technology. As you can see in the photos I used a type of foam to help absorb some sound on the way out you can use something similar, fiberglass works well also. I have tested it and measured the sound with a sound meter and found that it works quite well. At about 85% noise reduction. This DOSE NOT restrict air flow, as this would not be good.

The first fully printable airplane with suitable files prepared for your 3D printer. Flight characteristics are comparable or even better than classic model airplanes. Simply download and then print it anytime you need only for $10 (filament cost). Both the wings and the fuselage feature extensive high-tech, 3d structural reinforcement which makes the model very rigid while still maintaining a lightweight airframe and exact airfoil even when it is made only from plastic. This perfect and exact 3d structure is possible only due to additive 3d printing technology. So welcome to the 21th century of model flying. Be the first at your airfield with this new technology. Of course we comply with the ACES air combat rules.
Easy to assembly, you do not need any extra tool or hardware, you only need to glue printed parts together. The rest of the assembly is very easy. Simply add brushless motor, ESC, servos and radio system. Don´t worry, a detailed step by step PDF/VIDEO is included. You will get superb performance airplane with high power efficiency which will let you fly 7+ minutes at full throttle while exceeding 150 kph.

0,11115,S.U.E. MakerTron Robot,"S.U.E. (Structural Unification Engineer) is designed to directly assist in the rebuilding of the Maker Tron species. The first in the line of new Maker Tron's, she has been equipped with the latest earth technology that we have to offer in terms of manufacturing and replication. The array of optical sensors that she has placed on her head allow for full 3d imaging and analysis of the remaining C.O.R.E.'s. This allows her to visualize the best possible combination of hardware for each unique C.O.R.E.. The elongated head makes room for multi threaded processors in addition to the ones found in the main compartment of her own C.O.R.E.. She is highly intelligent and creative. Because of this enhanced processing power, she is equipped with additional arms and ports for swapping out or adding extra hardware for creation. Not just brains, but with the brawn to complete most any task, her arms are reinforced and resemble the robotic arms found in automated assembly lines. Also equipped is a shoulder mounted 3d scanner and projector, for real time modeling and collaboration. The canisters on her arms contain 3d printing materials for rapid prototyping and production. Her long surgical fingers are ideal for precision assembly and fine tuning her creations. The hover base's design was inspired by a technician's lab coat, the front flaps keep her thrusters shielded from debris that might be flying around while she hastily assembles parts onto the C.O.R.E.s. The hover base allows for increased maneuverability around the assembly lab.
It was important to me to match the design language established with Remix, while adding additional detail where desired. The outer shell has a layered flow to it along with the tubes and other elements that are similar to the ones used on Remix. I also wanted to maintain the theme of being able to swap out other parts, adding ports on the shoulders and base, giving whoever prints this model the option to add additional elements to my design.
Pieces are broken out and oriented for an FDM printer.

0,11117,8020 Dead Spool Holder,"This is a spool holder that slides on my 8020 1515LITE bar and holds the unused spool. This is a dead holder which means it does NOT allow the spool to spin. Name taken from live center & dead center on a lathe. Not a play on the Dirty Harry movie. The shape is identical to my 8020 Live Spool Holder. Design is printable without support. This spool holder has enough clearance to slide on the end of the 8020 bar and be easily positioned for narrow or wide spools. I designed it for spools as small as 160mm diameter, but will work with any size spool you can find. There are two set of holes on the part not being used. I just like having holes. By using 1 live holder and a bunch of dead holders, I can stack all my spools on a single bar of 8020 and easily move them from the stored position to the used position.",27571,Servo Invado
0,11118,8020 Live Spool Holder,"This is a spool holder that slides on my 8020 1515LITE bar and allows the spool to spin. I will be making a dead version that holds a spool that is only meant for storage, since I only need 1 live spool at a time. The 8020 bar is part of my Replicator table I buiild from scrap 8020 stock. This spool holder has enough clearance to slide on the end of the 8020 bar and be easily positioned for narrow or wide spools. I designed it for spools as small as 160mm diameter, but will work with any size spool you can find. I designed it around parts I had on hand from previous projects. Made with shoulder screws and flanged bearings with extended inner rings. Were I designing from scratch and not recycling parts on hand, I'd use a cheap cam follower. There are a set of holes on the part not being used. I put them there to hold a 1/2"" long standoff (F/F #4-40). The fear was the parts would not slide on the 8020 and would need to be stiffened. They are not needed, the shoulder screws work fine. Design is V2, V1 was a single piece design that needed support. This prints quicker and has no overhanges that require support.",27571,Servo Invado

It has attachments to mount this to your OEM Makerbot Replicator 2 arms. I will revise once I get my aluminum arm upgrade, one day. It is the Thing that keeps on giving, you also get a super adjustable camera mount, with adjustability in the Y axis, Z axis and a pan axis. Enough adjustment to keep you away from trouble and still get the shot. I use this for my Astroprint setup. NOTE: Photos show alpha unit. All improvements were added to the design and the beta design is what you download here. The alpha unit works well enough for me, I don't need to print beta.

The part is a bit bulkier than it needs to be, but it was designed to print well, it's solid and will hold your iPhone securely. If you don't have this Thule case, this will not work for you. But this case is highly recommended, well worth owning if you need a case anyway. It is most secure when mounted on the center of the camera as it is widest at the center, but will be still usable if you only push the mount about 20mm up from the bottom.",27571,Servo Invado

0,11124,L Plate for Sony NEX-5R,"Custom designed Sony NEX-5R. This design is the 5th iteration of my design. I could have stopped at #2, which was working fine. But I tweaked it to perfection. Fully compatible with any Arca-Swiss style quick-release system, this plate feature precisely contoured anti-twist features that meet the organic shape of the camera body for a perfect fit that prevents twisting between the camera and our plate. The design utilizes a captured ¼""-20 mounting screw that threads into the tripod mounting socket of the camera body. The design has holes for 3 ¼""-20 brass threaded inserts, TriStar Industries H2520 x 364P. This allows you further mounting options. I used a MeFoto tripod screw which has a hex head, so I embedded a hey key in the part so I always have the tool with me. The camera L-plate features two dovetail mounting surfaces in the shape of an “L""; one on the horizontal and one vertical. This allows for quick mounting on your tripod for landscape or portrait setups. This is a single piece design that is lightweight. It has smooth rounded corners that feel good in your hands.

0,11136,Makertron Design Contest : Maintenance Drone,"The Maintenance Drone variant of the Makertron unit adds flight capabilities to the base system, alongside enhanced manipulation systems. Equipped with lifting units in place of the arms, these allow for precise vectored thrust in forward and reverse, pitching at the shoulders, & complemented by an antigravity disc in place of the leg units which pivots at the hip in 2 directions. Extendable grappling arms are provided at the front and rear of the disk in order to perform a variety of maintenance tasks out of reach of the normal Makertron configuration.
I have tried to retain a sense of the ""retro"" design ethos of ""Remix"", which is reflected particularly in the streamlined saucer-section which replaces the legs, evoking flying saucer imagery.
Modelling note : The downloadable geometry comprises 4 models in .OBJ format - the head, one lifting unit, a lifting unit rotor, and one half of the antigravity disk -  the design has bilateral symmetry & so duplicates of the disk and lifting unit & rotor need to be printed - with the disk, an opposing lug and hole system is used to lock the parts together - the lifting unit has a separate rotor geometry which can be printed separately in a semi-flexible material and then inserted after printing into the rotor casing.
The standard Makertron pin system is used for connecting the parts to the main body.

0,11195,Earthquake Commemorative 3D Print,"On September 16th 2015, the northern region of Chile was hit by a magnitude 8.4 earthquake and tsunami that devastated many coastal towns. Due to high standard construction and a population used to natural disasters, the quake only killed 13 people.
In honor of all the Chileans killed and injured by the earthquake, and all those who lost their houses and jobs, I designed a desktop stand for smartphones reproducing the Relative Moment Rate Function of the earthquake. It describes the rate of moment release with time after de earthquake origin, relative to the peak moment rate (7.22e+26 dyne-cm).
Information was taken from USGS webpage. The 3D model was created in Sketchup, exported to .stl format and printed on a PRUSA I3 HEPHESTOS 3D printer (layer height = 0.2). Finally was finished with spray paint.

0,11264,Replicator 2X Fan Duct with mounting holes for 2 5mm LED lights,For a long time I've been using a flashlight to peer into the underworld of my 3D printer. I felt it was finally time to add it directly into the machine. When the fan duct got an upgrade I decided this was the perfect opportunity. This is the V4 duct with mounting holes for 2 LEDs. The wires conveniently fit between the top of the duct and the bottom of the bearings so they don't rub or get in the way. Connected to a stand alone 3V power supply with a switch. Do Not print this in PLA. It will warp over time (100+ hrs) and eventually interfere with the print.,14553,Steven Furick
0,11265,Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Car Mount / Case,"I used this file to attach my note 4 to my existing car mount. ""Full Bumpers"" could be a good starting point for a custom Note 4 case. ""Bumpers"" reduced the amount of plastic to make it easier to get the phone in and out of the holder. ""Slotted Adapter"" is specific to my car mount and clicks into place. I used a soldering iron to weld it into place on the back of the phone mount. ""Finger Bumper"" is the same as ""Full Bumpers"" but leaves a cutout for access to the stylus pen. As a result the bottom right bumper has slightly less of an overhang.",14553,Steven Furick

Makes for a cute little crab model for anyone who likes crabs. They also stack in an amazing number of ways. I have consumed quite a few hours playing with them. After printing my first two I knew I had to have more!,14553,Steven Furick
0,11270,Universal Spool Holder Makerbot Octave ToyBuilderLabs Filament R,"I added in No Support Spool Holder which is now my recommended print. Generated support has come a long way and this now prints better that way. I also added a little reinforcement to keep the piece from breaking when in use. Still recommend 75%-100% infill V5 minor modifications to improve printing. Reinforced legs on the ToyBuilder and Makerbot holders so they are less likely to break if you push on them too hard. V4 Added a ToybuilderLabs holder. Technically the Makerbot one will work but it's next to impossible to get it through the hollow center of the spool. V3 Added a 10mm shorter Octave spool holder Reinforced the walls of the Universal mount. Highly recommend 100% infill for structural strength Added the Inventor Project File V2 extended the makerbot version so that it fits the larger spools. Octave spool holder more flexible and rounded for better printing. This is a spool holder that replaces the one that came with the 2X. The ""holder"" is a univeral fit and can accept any type of Spool core. Currently Makerbot and Octave are supported.",14553,Steven Furick
0,11271,Leave on tool holder attachment for 2x v4,V4 increased the width of the arms to prevent cracking when inserting the gauge. Also uploaded Inventor Part file for community modifications. Added an STL with multiple mounting points. Improved the design to maximize stability and provide a better platform for the dial gauge. Added connections on the side for attaching tools giving maximum flexibility. The one piece clips onto the heat sinks of the 2x and provides a platform for other tools to be attached to. It's designed specifically to be left on the printer and it doesn't interfere with normal printing or leveling. Any attachments just need a notch so they can slide on and off the front end.

0,11273,Water-Tron Ronnie,"Ronnie the rounded Maker-Tron is made to be smooth in appearance and build to fit his purpose, being an underwater Maker-tron. His parts are all watertight to prevent leaking and smooth/rounded to increase his maneuverability when submerged. His fingers are small and precise so that he can pick up even the tiniest of objects off the sea floor. His cyclops like eye is protected by a visor with both night vision and heat vision to help see in the dark or murky waters. His 3 antennae allow him to communicate with the surface.                            Ronnie's legs and head should be printed standing up with supports. His arms should be printed laying down, also with supports.  ",28250,daleervin3

0,11292,Sailboat,"Small Sailboat hull designed for the Make It Float challenge. It is all designed around being able to be printed on a my printrbot simple XL. If printing goes well I might make a remote controlled version. The Design of the hull is an original design that plays off of design characteristics of many full size sailboats. My design goal was to create a hull that was very printer friendly yet still reminiscent of a real sailboat. All parts were designed using Sketchup. The hull is designed to be printed with no need for support material if parts are set up like in the print setup file. The Hull pieces are designed to print at 75% or higher infill. The bow and stern pieces can be printed at a lower infill 10% should be more then enough. I am planing on printing soon and will make note if infill needs to be changed. The keel and rudder parts should be printed at 100% infill. The Hull is designed to be printed by any experience level and the assembly should be also able to be finished with little experience in 3D printing or modeling. Tools: -Hobby Knife -CA Glue -Hand Drill + Drill Index -Sandpaper (80 Grit) Good Luck Printing!!
Update #1 6/22/2015 MKII I finished the initial design of the hull, keel and rudder. I have printed the keel and rudder with good success I have posted pics of both of them finished. The keel has 34 dimes in it to act as counter balance. I am going to start printing the hull tomorrow hopefully. I have redesigned almost ever part of the hull. I added pin locators to the hull panels. I also added areas in the hull to place more dimes to make sure the hull floats on the right water line.
Update 6/25/2015 The first of the hull pieces are coming off of the printer and I am very happy with the way they are printing. One of the things I always try to do is design around not needing any support materials. So far The design seems to be printing fine without needing any. I have also started to look into how I can add mounting locations for RC gear (servos, batteries, receiver). I want to make it so that only a few pieces would have to be reprinted to go from static to RC. I've also been working on the mast and rigging setup and should have those files posted soon. I do plan on putting together a instruction document but I am waiting for the first hull to be printed. It will contain information on how I printed each piece as well.
Update 6/29/2015 I am on the final stretch on printing the hull pieces then I move to the deck. So far every print has come out as designed with little to no post process clean up required. I have also decided to use hot glue over CA for the assembly of the hull. The hot glue allows me to push more glue between the seams to assure a tight seal. I have also done some work on the rudder. I re sized the bearing so that it has less play and also added a tiller. The tiller is set up to hook up to a servo if I do plan to add RC systems to the boat. I will post these files tonight. Hopefully water testing will start in just a few days! The hull is now fully printed! Working on a testing video which I hope to have posted very soon. I have also have started working on a stand to hold the boat when it is out of the water. Should have those files posted soon.
Update 7/2/2015 IT FLOATS!!! The hull is all together and tested now! It was also able to support the added load of ~3.2 lbs of coins. There were a few issues found after the testing though. The first major issue was print quality. Due to print hiccups there are a few micro cracks that allow water to inter into the hull. I plan to add some kind of an exterior coating to fix the leaks. I am working on printing the stand now and will post the files for it soon. Then onto printing the deck! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drBgqX2rxfY&feature=youtu.be
Update #3 7/16/2015 I have changed a few pieces of the hull. The stern and two rear panels have a new alignment system now. I also changed the bow so that it has less weight in it to help it float higher on the water line. I am printing the parts for the mast today and should have pics up very soon. https://youtu.be/gqDTMTm4KUA",29134,luke_gossman

The pieces are also designed to be easily gripped between two fingers when playing.
The king is a 1-3/4"" base and is 4"" tall. The set is fully printable without support.  The overhang on the knight's face is quite agressive so print the knight with .2mm layers for no drooping.

0,11306,Volkswagen broken car remote hack,"A simple 3D-printable clamp designed to solve one of the problems with Volkswagen cars - meaning specifically how to fix broken enclosures of the car key remote.
It is common that the snap-fit cantilever beam holding the two enclosure halves, breaks if the remote is dropped on the floor.
Such car remotes are expensive to replace and therefore the most obvious solution is to try to repair them.
Since glueing the enclosure halves makes it difficult to replace the battery, a good solution is to opt for a non-intrusive design that holds the two halves together.
This thing is designed to 3D-print easily and act as a spring lever that holds both enclosure halves together.
The only change to the car remote is to drill a small notch on the metal-key-halve of the enclosure. Please see related images and video for reference.
Even though this is a somewhat odd 3D file which only is useful for owners of Volkswagen cars, it shows how 3D printing can be used to save money and prolong the lifespan of a defective product. By http://Creative-Tools.com

0,11311,H.E.E.R.O. (MakerTron Contest),"H.E.E.R.O. (Humanoid Emergency Engineering Robot) was designed by the humans to assist in the restoration of the Maker Tron. Manufactured by Triobase Inc., H.E.E.R.O. incorporates the latest human technology into the C.O.R.E. Mainframes. Capable of an immense processing power thanks to his revolutionary head design, H.E.E.R.O. has one of the latest 3D sensors developed by Triobase, which help him scan and visualize his  surroundings. Two separate CPUs control each of the sensors located on the front of the head, which allow H.E.E.R.O. to focus and process multiple things at the same time. Engineers at Triobase developed an advanced assembly algorithm, which allows H.E.E.R.O. to assemble multiple C.O.R.E.s in the best possible way. The humanoid shape allows H.E.E.R.O. to move around the assembly lab in an agile way, speeding up the assembly times. Triobase did not forget about the defensive aspect of the robot either. Equiped with a Bō, a piece of martial arts weaponry developed by the Japaneese, H.E.E.R.O. is able to defend himself in a non-lethal but effective way.

The ""forks"" (the part that breaks off and causes this mess) needed to be widened to go around the peg in the controller, and they needed to be positioned a little bit lower to properly fit it in the slot. I also widened the side slots a bit because it took pressure to fit the cover down onto those little guide rails Someone at the NMRA meeting also mentioned that the raised letters interfered with the battery when they tried this model, so I made the lettering recessed instead. (And yes, I left the logo alone. ASMR created 99% of this file, I just tweaked 3 or 4 dimensions to make it work. Hat tip.)

0,11340,Baffling Puzzle Ball,"Its two baffling puzzles, a race game, a ball, and a safe in one. First, see who can assemble it in the least amount of time. Then once assembled, see if your friends can take it a part. It's almost impossible when you don't know the secret. Unlike most interlocking ball puzzles, this one uses a totally new, unique and unpublished secret to make it work. There is no one key piece. Made of 6 identical interlocking pieces, once assembled, the ball expands or contracts as the 6 interlocking pieces are pulled apart or pushed together. Most puzzlers will quickly see how the pieces fit together to form the ball. The challenge is in the physical dexterity required to orient, position and coordinate all six pieces preciously enough to slide together. Once mastered, it is fun to see how quickly you can assemble the ball. Challenge your friends and family to see who is the fastest. There are (at least) two different solutions for quickly assembling the puzzle.
Once assembled, it is a magic ball with a secret compartment inside that can only be opened by the owner. This moderately difficult puzzle ball is guaranteed to challenge both your physical dexterity and puzzle solving logic.
Children today are losing motor skills from spending too much time on computers and not enough time engaged in a variety in physical activities. Here is a toy for children to play with, improve dexterity and exercise their brains while having fun. Take this toy with you for hours of fun without electricity or internet. Also very good for rehabilitation and regaining lost motor skills.
Fast and easy to print; NO SUPPORT; NO WASTE. Scalable. Prints in about 1 ½ hours on most printers.
Instructions
Print 6 copies of the supplied file. Choose a variety of colors to create your own unique look. It is scalable, but I recommend using the supplied scaling to start. Use 0.2 mm layer with 25% infill. Material cost is about $1. For a more difficult puzzle (tighter) scale the Z dimension up a few percent; for an easier puzzle (loser fit), scale the Z dimension down a few percent.
I've posted the solution on my YouTube channel. Please don't look unless you've given up and are totally stuck. For a hint see my 3 piece hexagon puzzle; it uses the same secret, but in a simpler 2 dimensional way.

0,11378,London Phone Booth,"Summary A model of the London red phone booths. This will make a nice little space waster on your desk at home or at work! Or to save up to go and see the world! Please read the instructions for more information about this project. Thanks for checking out this thing! Franciscozapski has kindly printed this to show that it is indeed printable. Make sure you select the correct file to print! A friend of mine has agreed to print this, but I don't know when he'll be able to. When it is done, I'll post the pics of the printed booth! This model stands roughly 15cm tall (~5.9' inches) and I recommend printing it at full scale to preserve the detail. Instructions I decided to do this project because I think the red phone booths of London are a special landmark that everyone will know about. Also, I think they look really cool. I used stock images of the phone booths to gauge the relative sizes of all the components, then took to work recreating them with some software. I also chose a scale to ensure that this object can be printed without any further assembly, although I decided to add a version that can be assembled (with a hinged door). This model was created in AutoCAD, although I am still quite a novice at the software. This is also a great learning experience for me. Phase 1 (18/07/2015): The very first upload. This is simple the box shape with some indented windows for some added detail. I'm currently occupied with other commitments, so I couldn't do a very detailed piece initially. NB: This design is currently a solid block! So don't print it unless you feel like wasting a lot of precious filament. For the next update I plan to add some edge detail, and address the solidness of the object, which will make it more print-friendly. Phase 2 (20/07/2015): I made some time to get a little bit of work done on the model. Changes conveniently summarised for your reading pleasure: • Added ""Telephone"" text • Added more detail to the roof • Added a base • Made it hollow Yes, that's right! The booth is now hollow on the inside and should therefore be more economical to print. Stay posted for phase 3, where I plan to add extra detail and properly lay out the roof! Phase 3 (24/07/2015): A hectic week! I redesigned the entire roof of the booth, which was quite tricky. I still haven't gotten to the result I want, but this will have to suffice for now. Otherwise, not much has changed. A quick update on what has: • Redesigned roof • Added some detail to the back of the booth The detail at the back will probably change as well, due to it not lining up with the windows... It's just a preliminary design for the next release. Stay tuned for the next update where I plan to add detail to all sides of the booth. Phase 4 (28/07/2015): I haven't been getting a lot of time to work on the model but I did manage to do the following: • Redesigned roof (again) [There was a little piece bothering me] • Redid detail at the back of the booth • Added detail to all sides (including a handle) • Completely hollow Now, I don't know what the support implications will be of making this thing hollow, but according to this site it should be printable on a MakerBot Replicator. I still do plan to make some changes to this model. Perhaps a version that prints in pieces and requires assembly to save material (from supports). I have a few surprises planned for this design, though. So keep watching! Phase 5 (01/08/2015): With the weekend comes the following small adjustment: • Added a phone What is a phone booth without a phone? I think the next update will be the final one, which will consist of a dismantled version that requires assembly, as well as a surprise... Phase 6 (09/08/2015): This is the final design! I have been so extremely busy with other work that I almost forgot about the deadline. With this final version comes the following changes: • Now made to assemble • The door has (supposedly) working hinges! • A coin bank version is available Thanks for checking out this thing. If you want to download the assembly version, download the 2 files that have ""assembly"" in the title. If you want to coin bank, download the file with that says ""coinholder"" in the title.

0,11384,MakerTron Arduino Smart Flight Suit,"In order to help the MakerTron rebuild their population, I thought I would give them flight! Not only was this jetpack and wing suit specially designed with the best of Earth's open source technology, Arduino, but it is a great exercise to teach other earthlings how to design basic circuits, program, solder, 3D print, and much more! I know it probably isn't as advanced as the MakerTron's original technology, but I think it will do for now. This specific chip is an Adafruit Flora which is the perfect size to pair up with the MakerTron Core. On the bottom of the jetpack is a micro-USB port for updating software as we develop more gadgets for the robot. I'm still working out all of the flight dynamics for the rocket boosters, so if anyone has experience in rocketry or is a current employee at NASA, go ahead and drop me a line at shookdesignllc@gmail.com! The next ""smart"" upgrades on the list for MakerTron are shown below:
GPS Location
Accelerometer
Color Sensing
Light Sensing
Bluetooth Connectivity
As for the other parts, I made sure to put a lightweight, 500 mAh, lithium polymer battery in his jetpack to make sure he doesn't have to be plugged in. The RGB LED lights on the wings were specially designed for night time flight or for use in the dark, lonely depths of our universe. They are really, really bright! I'm working on the detailed assembly instructions right now, but in the meantime, like this design and vote for this entry in the MakerTron contest!

I bought a meter of M5 threaded rod and divided it in 4 pieces, (so I had some spare-parts for when it happens again) when I connected it to the socked my radio worked great again, it only looked crap. so i thought lets make something i can screw over the M5-rod. next thing i did: I made a pipe(inner diameter 4.6mm outer diameter 5.4mm in solidworks and tryed experimenting with slic3rs spiral vase settings, after some experimenting I finally found the right settings to make the female M5 thread to fit over my rod. Settings I used: Nozzle size: 0.8 (mine is just 0.4 but otherwise I cant make a layer thickness of 0.75) Layer thickness : 0.75 speed: very low (7mm/s) perimeters: 1 fan speed: a constant 70% material settings: filament diameter: 1.75 then I set the extrusion multiplier on 2.21 because i needed atleast dubbel the amount of material because of the layer thinkness and width i wanted. after that i needed to scale the object so it would fit my M5 threaded rod, so in the end I scaled the object to 144% normal size. result> ""Female"" M5 threaded-rod I also tryed printing the ""male M5 threaded-rod by scaling my pipe down to 61% and worked great aswell. Hope this is Usefull to someone ^^",27870,Paul van Doorenmalen

http://youtu.be/bYjNlO6f0x4
Instructions 
Printed in ABS Plastic.
You need to make sure it sticks really well to your build bed when printing!! The footprint connected to the bed is very small. 
0.2mm layer height 
100% infill (probably overkill?) 
3 layers top, bottom and perimeters 
Printed holes need drilling out as they are too small. I used a 1.5mm drill bit. When you drill out the 4 holes at the bottom facing back towards the hose make sure you drill perpendicular to the face that the holes are on. 
Fasten to hose securely using a poly ratchet clamp or metal hose clamp. 
It worked OK with normal mains water pressure but would work alot better with higher pressure. 
WARNING!! 
I haven't tested with high pressure (ie pressure washer) so if you are thinking of trying to do that then PLEASE make sure the fitting is well inside a pipe before turning on the pressure washer. NEVER have the fitting out in the open when using high pressure water!! The fitting might just explode and do some very nasty damage to you or someone else!!

0,11599,Push Lamp,"I recently discovered the joys of translucent printer filament and decided I'd have a go at making something which could use that property in a fun but useful way. Later, when shopping in the blue and yellow wonderland that is Ikea, I also spotted the Ramsta magnetic lighting unit and thus hatched a plan... For this print you will need to buy two additional items; one of the aforementioned Ramsta lighting units (available from any Ikea or online for less than two quid) and one 5x3mm neodymium magnet (available from eBay for very small sums of money). 1) Stick the magnet to the bottom of the Ramsta to find out which way the internal magnet is polarised. 2) Turn the magnet over and superglue it into the baseplate so that pole faces upwards (so the magnet will attach itself to the Ramsta and hold the plate in place). Keep it WELL away from any electronic equipment as neodymium magnets are very strong and won't do your iPhone any favours at all. 3) Place the Ramsta onto the baseplate and put one half of the base around it. Do NOT glue it in place or you'll never be able to change the batteries when they die. 4) Slot the lamp into place. This you can glue if you want. I didn't on the prototype model but there's no reason it couldn't be done. 5) Superglue the side faces of the other half of the base, making sure not to get any glue on the bottom or in the curved half-hole where the lamp sits. 6) Slot the glued half into the base plate, bringing the two halves together, and huff on it until they stick solidly. Your Push Light is now ready to use!  UPDATE - If you can't get magnets, or don't want to, just use the Ramsta's sticky pad to stick the light to the baseplate.  It won't be as removable but it'll still do the job.",27248,EnterpriseXD

I have fully machined hardened X-axis shafts available
UPDATE 3/26/16 Belt grip can be glued into place with acetone. I added three screws to secure the belt.
UPDATE 4/24/15 Added a carriage STL for usage of the original Da Vinci bushings
UPDATE 3/24/15 7:15 pst. Downloads after this time have the updated carriage for better heater clearance.
UPDATE: The hot end can be rotated to any direction to clear the carriage. Most MK8 hotends have an insulated barrier around the heater block also. Instructions Heater block can be rotated 90 dg for better carriage clearance. Round bearing hole is 15.4mm, half bearing hole is 15.2mm for better fitment of 15mm linear bearings.",29346,chris_call
0,11620,Da Vinci 1 3D Printer - E3D Hotend with MK8 Extruder ver.1,"Please feel free to donate through Paypal to jeeplvr2000@yahoo.com and I will keep the designs coming Allows Da Vinci 1 users to adapt a ""Genuine"" E3D V6 hotend and MK8 extruder in to a Da Vinci 1 3D printer UPDATE 3/22/15 There are lack of space issues with the Teflon tube and fitting that inserts into the top of the hot end. See the instructions for details. I have fully machined hardened X-axis shafts available
UPDATE 3/22/15 Modified the carriage to accept a retaining bracket for the hot end. Also added a retaining bracket for the hot end.
UPDATE 3/21/15 8:50pm pst Replaced the carriage file with a file with a better cooling duct. Instructions Hotend Teflon tube fitting clearance issue: One solution may be to remove the tubing fitting or cut it off flush with the top of the hotend and insert the Teflon tubing directly into the hotend. Make it stick out of the top of the hotend just enough to be inside the 6mm threads of the MK8. The required Teflon tubing is 4mm OD and the hole in the MK8 is tapped to 6mm. The ID of the threads in the 6mm hole (about 5mm) should be close enough to the OD of the Teflon tube (4mm) to keep the tube centered. If the tube is loose in the threads of the MK8 you could wrap a piece of tape around the tube to get a better fit. This is just a suggestion. Print on the right side for better print results. Depending on how accurate your printer prints holes the bearing holes may need to be drilled or reamed to fit 15mm bearings or 16mm bearings. The bearings holes are drawn at exactly 15mm. Permanently glue the belt grip into the carriage with acetone.",29346,chris_call

UPDATE: 4/25/15 Added a carriage stl that has through holes for bushings longer than the factory bushings. ""Davinci_w_bush_thru.stl"" Update: 3/10/15 Added a 15mm ""Bearing Spacer""
Update: 2/13/15 I added 3 new files, 15mmx.stl, 16mmx.stl, ext cap with conn.stl. The first two are of the carriage with 2mm shaved off the bottom for better clearance of the bed screws. The third file is of the stepper cap with a new area cut out for a stepper with a pin connector.
Update: 2/18/15 Added a carriage that uses the Da Vinci bushings instead of the linear bearings. Instructions The new carriage design does not have a flag for the X axis end stop since my Da Vinci has mechanical end stops that stick out farther than the optical stop originally did. If you need the X end stop ""flag"" or ""boss"" on the extruder you can print one and secure it to the new carriage with acetone or whatever works for you. The Hexagon hot end utilizes a slotted aluminum plate to secure the hot end. The Hexagon hot end kit comes with, hot end, slotted mount plate, thermistor, connectors, 40mm fan, tools, setscrews, cover for the heater. The belt gripper is printed separately to get the best results.

Extruder mount to accept a Nema 17 stepper in place of the original Nema 14 stepper. Read the instructions. Instructions It is nearly a direct bolt in but is longer and requires a modified magnet mount. The back magnet on the mag mount is moved back 5mm to properly position the new Nema 17 motor So far so good. It runs way cooler than the original Nema 14 motor. The gear from the old motor fits perfectly even though the new shaft is longer and keyed. Just shove the gear on to its original position and cut off the extra shaft with a good hack saw..

ORIGIN
Omega Celestial is a very sophisticated humanoid robot evolved many generation later after their predecessor Omega-1 which the human built. Omega-1 had served humans for many years exploring many planets habitations and finding new materials.
Human have sent special enhanced Omega out the the solar system to further their exploration in space. These special enhanced Omega have somehow acquired feelings and awareness of their own identity. Soon after, many has scatter across the universe by themselves and has establish their own culture which makes each of them unique in many different ways. They have their own ways of expressing themselves, every single details we observe from their body parts symbolized their origin from where they came from.
FUNCTIONALITY
OVERALL
Omega Celestial has a mask and marking on their forehead to show their ranking. They comes from different sizes from muscle to agility to play their parts in their community.
HEAD
Omega Celestial has a build in communication system and an additional external antenna for communication when facing unknown or extreme weather condition.
HAND
Omega Celestial has a pair of tough hand that are suit well in combat and rescue mission. They are proportionally big and has the same length as an apes which makes them super flexible when trying to moves around instead of entirely depend on their legs. They have buttons and ball controller that that allows them to customize and navigate other vehicle when needed.  Their elbow are part organic and thy can moves very naturally like human does. They also have two shoulder plate on both side marking their origin to which star they are from.
LEG
Omega Celestial has a strong hip and a very stable knee. The proportion of the leg are design to let them run and jump at high levels while lands on his feet with no errors of falling.

0,11734,One-piece fan/heatsink duct with microswitch homing (x- and z-ax,"Summary As I had difficulties getting the supplied IR sensor to function properly I made this modification to the design by iamburny I've made a small alteration to the one-piece fan/heatsink duct, allowing swapping the IR sensor with a microswitch. And it WORKS - I've printed the last 10 prints or so without any problems. When homing z this mod drives the nozzle into the bed until the duct pivots and activates the ms. Homing the x axis takes advantage of the bulb present on the acryllic xrib. Cudos also has to go to KimBrown (father of bigblue http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:448906) for giving the inspiration to use a ms. Instructions This mod requires a bit of changes. First off the ms needs to be wired into the duet as seen on the wiring diagram. Secondly the homing gcodes has to be changed (found last in this note). This can surely be done smarter than what I've come up with, as the x is homing it rams the hotend into the far end of the x axis if the starting point isn't relativly close to x = 0.

OR Formula to build a regular polygon (works with any scale) R=S/2sin(180/N) Where: R= radius of outside wall (center of it) S= Side length of 01 wall section N= number of sides on the perimeter wall. Example square N=4, octagon N=8, ETC How to use it? Build a small wall section + two tower Measure the distance between the center of the towers. (S) Decide how many sides you want the perimeter wall to have. (N) crunch the numbers and find the radius. Draw a circle with the calculated measurement. Go around this line marking the distance S, You will get N number of tower marks, matching the spacing perfectly. OR Use one of the pre-calculated Radius/Side proportions. 4 sides 1 S = 0.707 R 5 sides 1 S = 0.85 R 6 sides 1 S = 1.00 R 7 sides 1 S = 1.152 R 8 sides 1 S = 1.307 R Working with sand: Plan your build, do the math, check the weather.

Please read the instructions for optimal print of this parts!!!! Instructions Printed in PLA, 0.2 layer hight, 2 shells/0.8mm - Cura (use this if you have 0.4 nozzle like me - the parts are made for this nozzle size and 2 shells), fill 100%. You eventually need to clean the surfaces with a rasp and make some small chamfers. I did not left any clearance between the two housings so that you don't need glue for keeping them together, push hard and be carefull to not brake the parts. Also, once fitted together, you have to push the arms of the idler apart gently so that the bearing+housing will fit between the two bearing brims of the idler.

If you have long blade endstop, you can use stormychel's brackets here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:858307 However, my design is only a modification to stormichel's design, so, all credits to him lcd bracket - if you use the LCD12864 like me and you don't want to print a box for the lcd, than this is your bracket.

You'll have to use a fine file/rasp to make place for the x belt tensioner.

0,11852,Mega Prusa Z Axis Anti wobble,"Summary Re update 26.07.2015: Modified with +5mm between M5 nuts for longer spring (original part was 15.5mm pocket, this is 20.5 pocket). Reinforced flanges with +1mm. More clearance on smooth rod mounting (+0.1) Print Z REG _plus 5.stl with 100% fill Update 26.07.2015: Added modified version for user smeric on request. The new version has: 5mm between M5 nuts for shorter spring added 1mm on the upper and lower flanges thickness to be more sturdy added more clearance (+0.1mm) on the 12mm opening for the smooth rod Print 100% fill Creation date: 09.06.2015 Installing the z threaded rod on the Mega Prusa, I felt that the clearance between the rod and the nut was too high. I modified this thing http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:141479 to fit the Mega Prusa project initiated by Aldric Negrier on http://www.instructables.com/id/Mega-Prusa-i3-Rework-8-x-Build-Volume/#step1. This thing is for M5 threaded rod and 12mm smooth rod. The difference between the original (thing:141479) and this is that this has longer inner hexnut pocket (15.5 mm) and higher contact lines between the part and the 12mm smooth rod. Is also a little longer to fit the distance between threaded rod and smooth rod Instructions You will need: 4x M5 nuts 2x ø8x10x1.1 springs 1x printed part left 1x printed part right (mirrored left) I printed this in black PLA sliced with Cura layer 0.3mm and shell 1.2mm (0.4 nozzle). Bottom and top thickness 2.4mm. It is important to have thick bottom and top because the springs are pretty strong and you will damage the printed part. Note: If you cannot make the rot to pass both nuts you have to stop a little bit before entering the second nut and push (tension the spring) and turn a little until the rod is catching the thread on the second nut. Find the best position between nuts unmounting and remounting one of the nuts keeping in mind that the thread in the nut/rod has only one beginning... This will give you bigger or smaller amount of tension in the spring depending in what position you catch the thread. !!!!!!! If the rod passes without tensions the two nuts, unmount the upper nut and rotate in other position. The idea behind this z antiwobble is that the mounting has to be tensioned so that the upper nut is making contact on the lower surface of the thread and the lower nut is making contact on the upper thread surface !!!!!!!! Find the smaller amount of tension in spring unmounting and remounting and rotating the nut. Tension too big will force the z motors to stop",27435,tibi_sucuturdean
0,11853,modded rostock for all metal extruder,"Summary well, i wasn't very happy with my Rostock so I modified some parts -the platform (see original here http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:31642 ) I added some more clearance for the hex nuts so now pushing them inside, the plaform doesn't crack -head mount top has a 9.3 mm hole for the pushfit bouder mount -ventilator mount is for 3 pieces of 25x25x10 12V ventilators. I had some problems with the all metal j-head extruder cooling so i added 3 ventilators -the arms on my Rostock where very flexible (glass fiber 5 mm diameter arms)... I have made some rigidizers for them, some kind of push-snap-fit stiffeners. This need some work after printing, you must cut off the surfaces with the ellipse holes, you will end up with 6x 220 mm long stiffeners to push on your arms The groove for the all metal j-head extruder on my Rostock is an 4mm alluminium plate, inspired from here http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:788096 Instructions printed at 0.2 layer / extruder 210°C / bed 70°C / PLA",27435,tibi_sucuturdean

0,11858,Celtic wristband,"Summary A simple celtic weave pattern bent into a circle. It is a little too detailed for my printer as you can see from the pic, but this would look nice on a better printer. Anyway, I am going to reduce the density of the weave in a future version, so you can see the detail more when printed at home. Also a wrist cuff version would be fun to do as well. The diameter of this first try is toooo big! Almost 100mm or 4"". So if you print this, print at about 70% scale. I'll upload smaller versions soon. V2 Uploaded.

0,11859,Filament stack with free spinning spools,"Summary This deign combines filament storage with dispensing. Shown here is a (4) color tower, but I think 6 to 8 color towers would work as well. This should be easy to grab from the top and move to your work area. Marbles are used as ball bearings. They are quite effective, the spools spin very freely. I used PVC tubing in this make. And the top and bottom pieces are ply as my printer is very small. The top and bottom stl's are included. Future versions or add on's might include vertical pieces that come in sections, 1 for each spool. And perhaps an improved means to feed the filament to the top of the tower before it connects to the printer. Also, I am considering a bearing that has a slight return to it so that the marbles pop into place and don't fall back out. I try to make everything I publish, but a few of these parts are untested - too big for me. Please let me know if you have prob's with them! The marble bearing cups are printed with solid infill. The bearing caps should have the toothed side facing upwards to bite into the bottom of the spool. These work with most spools, but not all. I used a flat disk on one spool with hot glue to hold it in place. 10 second video https://goo.gl/xPXSjY",29918,Joe Flatley

0,11905,X-Carve reverse drag link bracket,"Summary I remade the bracket that the 1000mm X-Carve uses on the left side bottom and I am using it on my 500mm X-Carve. I also reversed it so that I can feed my cables out the back of the system. I didn't like the way the 500mm X-Carve drag link chains were so I printed some of my own that were from the 1000mm version. The model is the standard bracket. I just flipped the model in Cura so that I could get a reverse of it so that it was correctly oriented when I put it on the back rail. You may have notice my front and back rails under the waste board are a bit longer and sticking out. I put longer rails in so the I could mount the X-Carve easier to my cabinet I made. Instructions I printed full infill because it is a support part. Print large flat side down. You can press in 2 M4 nuts to the top shelf. It is tight, but it holds the nut nicely. If you want to run this on the back, you just need to mirror flip it on your slicing software. Otherwise, it works great on the front of your X-Carve.",17552,Marty Enerson

0,11908,Ultimate Spool Holder for M3D Filament,"Summary This is an external filament holder that fits the small 120mm spools. The double bearings allow the narrow spools to ride in the gap between the two bearings. This helps with keeping the spool centered. You can print bolts and nuts here if you want. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:193647 Instructions I printed this at 100% fill. Parts print one holder 8 x 608 bearings. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BBGTK6?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00 12 x M8 flat washers 2 x M8 bolts. The bolts need to be 65mm long 6 x M8 nuts You can remove the washers between the bearings if you want. It helps reduce friction on the spools without the washers. Installation slide bolt into base then washer onto bolt then bearing onto bolt then washer onto bolt then bearing onto bolt then washer onto bolt then tighten a nut onto the bolt then tighten another nut onto the bolt then washer onto bolt then bearing onto bolt then washer onto bolt then bearing onto bolt then washer onto bolt then slide bolt into other side of base then attach nut to bolt I put washers on the outside of the base too, but you don't need to do that.",17552,Marty Enerson
0,11909,Ultimate Spool holder (double bearing),"Summary Do your prints have shifts? Is your filament tugging on the spool? Do you think there may be a better way? Now there is. This holder works with all types of spools with wide flanges, spools with narrow edges. The double bearings allow the narrow spools to ride in the gap between the two bearings. This helps with keeping the spool centered. One side of the holder is cut out to allow for small spools that are full of filament. Just flip the holder around to put the cutout on the inside and you are golden. On the big spools this isn't an issue. Instructions I printed these 100% fill. Parts print two holders. one for each side of the spool. 8 x 608 bearings. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BBGTK6?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00 12 x M8 flat washers 4 x M8 bolts and nuts.

Also, my bolts were 45mm, because that is what I had on hand.",17552,Marty Enerson
0,11910,DeWalt 611 Air Diffuser for X-Carve,"Summary I remade this thing to my liking. This is a remake and I give props to mathesonmd for the initial design. This is used to reduce the amount of dust spread around by the CNC machine. Instead of blowing air straight down onto the product, it will send it out the side instead. I updated to v2. I moved the screw holes out a couple mm so they line up better. I thinned the bottom layer by 1mm so that I get more wrench on the chuck nut. I flanged out the LED holes so more light comes out. I reduced the height of the screw mount section so that everything fit flat on the 611. I set countersinks for the screws so you can use the original screws that come with the 611. I chopped one side off to get better access to the lock button. This was my first use of OnShape.com CAD which is awesome... you should try it out (it's free).

I made the clip twice as thick (total of 6mm) and I closed up the gap a bit more so it holds onto the M3D cable better. I left the filament hole the same. The pictures above are 6mm thick, but I didn't tighten up the clamp part on those. It is tough to notice in a picture anyway, but it does help with the clamp pulling off the cable.",17552,Marty Enerson

0,11937,C Extruder for MK8 gear and J-head,"Summary ""C"" stand for the shape of the extruder. The extruder is a direct extruder model ready for MK8 gear and has on the plate a structure to hold the J-head with 2 screws. Motor used: NEMA 17. It is a sort of ""derivation"" of the Greg's Wade Extruder, I modified the idler to fit a direct drive, you can use the same bearings, spring and tension screws. The plate is flexible having oval holes to be fixed on the x-carriage. Instructions The extruder is printed in PLA at 60% infill to gain strenght with support material. All the parts are printed in the position I am realeasing the files here. Raft or brim can be a good idea to print the part that has a massive base to hold the motor and to be more stable. All the metal and electronic parts are the same I mounted on my previous Greg's Wade extruder except for the springs that I prefered a bit stronger. You will need to cut and file a bit the idler holder on the extruder main body. I am giving 2 versions of the main body extruder: one has round holes the other oval. The one with round holes is really precise on the stepper motor and you could have to remove very well some raft material to have a good fit. With the oval holes you can move a bit the screws to find your perfect fit even if the part cames out not so precise. The idler is a curved version of the Greg's Wade with rectification angle to have the screws pressure on a vertical plane and it uses 608ZZ bearing.",31507,Lord M
0,11938,Modular Bamboo BirdHouse,"Summary This is a modular system to create birdhouses with a natural shape of a bamboo log. Combining the parts with the connectors you can create your own unique birdhouse from the simple shaped ones to more complex figures. No limits in creating vertical or horizontal shapes nor combining the two directions with this system. Instructions All the parts can be assembled with M3 bolts and nuts. You need to insert in the internal rift the part without holes for the bolts (usually caps or connectors), close the second part and secure the birdhouse with nuts. To hang the birdhouse you can use three methods:
the roof with the ring, passing a rope to hang the birdhouse to a tree
you can secure the birdhouse with ropes or metallic wire under the roof and under the house assembling as last part the ""SolidBambooConnector"" and using its rift to lock the rope or metallic wire
you can drill one or more holes on the back of the birdhouse and hang it with nails or screws
The bamboo parts migh be printed 12cm tall and 9cm of diameter, the hole for the bird is of 3cm of diameter. I hope you enjoy my birdhouse and have fun creating your very own shape matching your needs. Original design made with Blender. The object is prepared for the 3D printer.",31507,Lord M

0,11997,STARBLASTER THE ULTIMATE MAKERTRON ROBOT,"INTRODUCTIONIn a universe now in the throes of decay and wars, one miracle of technology and the evolution can fix things .. his name is STARBLASTER.Defense and space explorer as well as commander of the platoon for the colonization of new worlds. Starblaster, proud and fearless, is the only one capable of being able to restore order in its galaxy to help Makertron to rebuild their society, and to help rebuild Maker society from the depths of space to the unknown. its motto is ""TO PROTECT AND DEFEND MAKERTRON NOT END!""The project for this contest, includes Following parts: head, legs, arms and a sword as accessory .Every piece comes with moving parts separately printable with a printer FDM. The name STARBLASTER was chosen thinking of the myriad of celestial bodies that one day, even with the aid of real robots, you can explore.Starblaster, infact is a robot scout suitable to command the troops during battle and exploratory missions. it is equipped with reactors placed on the legs and arms that can bring in the most obscure space, lights to scan the surfaces of planets, communications and recording limbs fast and resistant able to defend him in the worst of timesIts shell is light and functional with joints in thirteen points. I designed the parts, fit perfectly, through the help of the pin, to torso or C.O.R.E. of the original MakerTron the that is a key component, versatile and unique design. I imagine Starblaster consists of a reinforcement of lightweight titanium and carbon, all metal parts made of a composite of gold and platinum and plastic parts (tubes and fingers) made with plastic ultramodern, as you can see from the rendering.The overall StarBlast's height is 231mm ,the minimum thickness of the components is 0.6 mm and all movements can be preset by the project before printing,then print it in the position you want! and enjoy the conquest of new worlds!
THE HEAD is the control center of starblaster where his positronic brain allows them to decide all the strategies to use in battle and in the exploration of space. Two optical groups, similar to the eyes of a wasp, allow him a vision with an angle of 270 °, of course, the head can rotate on itself by 360 °.The two tubes, placed at the sides, not only act as protection, but carrying coolant to the front of the head to allow full operation of all systems.The flat antenna placed over the head component enables communication with all his colleagues during shipments or submitted during the battles for the colonization of planets and territories. Below are two openings protruding allow him to communicate with other forms of life and not only!. At the sides, the head is equipped with systems that scan the surfaces together in all types of sensors that allow also the operation in case the headlights become damaged.
THE ARMS are key parts for the unit Starblaster as allow him to perform most actions. Commanded by the control center, that is the head, can rotate 360 ° parallel and perpendicular to the body.They are equipped with thrusters to facilitate landings and space travel. The hand component is completely jointed and reconfigurable act to hold objects of any type. In fact hands, equipped with four fingers very large, not only are easy parts but they are also strong and resistant components.
THE LEGS are the other key component of this extraordinary miracle of evolution.Light and fast these arts, can jump 30 meters, then landing without damage, keep the center of gravity of Starblaster very low allowing an equilibrium and a speed of action never before seen.Surely ""the unit Starblaster"" not bend easily gets! . Anche these arts rotate 360 ° parallel to the body, they may bend up to 315 ° and naturally lend themselves to be redesigned with ease in the case Starblaster has to make an uppgrade. Moreover rockets more powerful than those mounted on the arms are placed on the back of the component not only to increase the speed but also to launch attacks mêlée most impressive!
These parts can be used by any type of MakerTron because they are versatile and functional. The most appropriate indication remains that of a unit from exploration as these lightweight parts and sophisticated.Starblaster is thought to command posts of the elite, it is elegant and proud, with his sword, the Casterblaster, as a leader, commands the troops to victory..."" for a universe that must be saved...to MakerTrons! ""
SETTING PRINT: FDM materials such as ABS - M301 or PC-ISO or better yet PLA for a better finish.The settings for a great success of the prototype with FDM print are:feedrate xyz 22 mm / s for each piece in the positions that most own pace to the machine operator.The temperature will vary depending on the material you will use,the number of pieces to be printed varies according to the work plan and the quality you want, I personally recommend a maximum of three pieces at a time ( All stl files are checked with netfabb to search for errors) Thank you for reading this presentation.",28861,luca_giuliani

Layer height 0,2mm for all pieces except the alium.stl, that should be a little more fine, like 0,15 or 0,12.
Print speed 40mm/s
alium.stl should be printed slowly! Too many details to rush the printer ;) about 20mm/s or less
The capsule is printed at once. There will be a 0,3mm gap between both parts so you can unstick them (there is a bridge in this file, prepare your active cooling!)
There is an extra capsule in 2 parts that fits together for those that can't put the main capsule working ;)
For the wheels, you should print the tires in flexible filament (it will work great!)
There is an extra file where the tires and the rims are fused together, for those that don't have flexible filament or don't want to have trouble fitting them to the rims.

0,12003,9-sided box,"I made this 9-sided box using the Grasshopper add-on to Rhino3D. Grasshopper is a parametric modeling package and thus allows all the parameters of a model to be changed dynamically.  The screenshot of the Grasshopper control panel shows all the settings for this box. Note that the knob on top of the handle can be either a torus (as shown), a dodecahedron, or a sphere. The top fits closely onto the bottom because there is a triangular ridge around the box's top edge that fits into a similar groove in the box top.

0,12013,Fallout 4 Logo,"Summary Working on building a Fallout 4 PS4 frame, this is the first and most important part, the Fallout logo. This is hand-traced using splines in Adobe Illustrator CS6 based on the Fallout 4 logo from a screen-cap of the trailer. Model is split in three files, the frame, the bolt, and the letters. Ran into lots of little issues with the original design, so I've updated with cleaner lines and thicker walls. There are now two versions of the letters, one that precisely matches the frame, and one that is 0.5mm thinner on all sides to account for the frame shrinking when it cools (and to some extent the settings of the printer). I chose to print the frame in silver, the letters in black, and the lightning in clear-orange. As you can see, this means light shines through the lightening bolt. Post-Printing A Couple Helpfull Hints For the most part the fits on the letters (using the thinner letters) were very tight. I had to file a couple sides and corners to make the fit smooth. You can see from one of the images, that I was a tad overzealous in a couple spots, so be judicious.",28061,alanbly

Instructions This is based on an old Blender rigging demo of a tentacle (http://mirror.cs.umn.edu/blender.org/demo/test/Octopus.blend) duplicated 4 times and arranged around an iPhone 6-Plus model. Exported to STL, sliced in MatterControl and Slic3r. UPDATE: Reworked to reorient the tentacles and flatten the base. Also added some fill on the base for the phone to sit on after a careless placement sent the stand flying. Much more stable this way. New file is TentacleStand.base.stl sliced with MatterControl's build in slicer. There does appear to be a void where the tentacles meet and my limited blender skills haven't been able to get rid of.

The carrier is meant to fit the default length x-carriage of prusa i3 (https://github.com/josefprusa/Prusa3) which i DIDN'T design myself. The great work of prusa i3 parts go to Joseph Prusa, well known in RepRap community. The two parts are designed airtight. If you have problems with fit-in-place parts you may consider using XY-compensation option of Slic3r or setup fake bigger nozzle diameter in your slicer (or you simply file down the parts slightly). It holds two cheap 8$ Chinahotends firmly and also can carry 2 fans. One 22mm Fan for hotend cooling and one 65mm (CPU) cooler for print cooling. Sliced well with CraftWare, Slic3r and RepetierHost->curaengine. Printed without support at .2mm layer --Update 2015-04-25: I increase the size of the front holes to fit M3 nuts. Also i modeled some supports and moved the hotend cooler 4mm lower. Now its even more easy to print and assemble. --Update 2015-06-20: I changed many diameters and spare places. Now it sits much better and is slightly more easy to assemble. However i can't upload new files right now, will come later. An preview of the finished thing is in the gallery. --Update 2015-08-08: Just uploaded the finished version. Any tolerances and spaced got tweaked many times. Now it carries an 40mm fan instead of the smaller one and it works simply great for me! The only update i might do is apply it to the carriage of the prusa i3 rework parts but that will be uploaded as a different thing.",29207,Klaus Daume

Just the with of the Belt is about 2mm and 1mm, unlike real GT2 belts. --update: printed with .2mm layer height, cut with slic3r. Did turn out very well. Just the corners must be modeled more open (smaller angle) --update 2014-07-31: Uploaded a stl file with the belt spinned. No small angles anymore and modifiers for printability are applied. Prints well with PlastInk rubber filament, cut with slic3r to ,2mm layer height. Didn't try any other layer heights so far, because rubber is a tricky to use filament.

I decided that it was too long to print and wanted to cut down time and material, so I designed one that could be assembled (and customized slightly).

Another project for my daughter's cosplay adventures, she wanted a small 'ammo pack' but needed it to fit her cell phone. The original was to large to print on my TOM, this one was scaled to fit within the 110mm build space. The pin used for the hinge is a large paper clip straightened out. The latch is friction fit, I sanded it down until it had a nice 'click' to it but was still easy to open.

0,12075,Strum Trigger for Guitar Hero guitar,"Summary Had a friend who was complaining about his Guitar Hero guitar being broken. After looking at the plastic bits he was able to salvage I crafted a replacement and printed it on my MakerBot. This is still a work in progress so if you print it you may need to adjust the mesh, he hasn't had time to re-assemble his guitar to confirm everything fits correctly. Two of the 'legs' have square recesses for magnets, while researching the trigger assembly it appears there are 4 types of electrical interfaces, this should fit all 4. UPDATED 11/14 - I was able to get the actual mechanism and have made adjustments for a better fit. The metal caps on the end of the original trigger fit over the pegs on each piece. Requires the spring return from the original trigger and two small screws to assemble properly. If you print this please let me know how it works for you, thanks!

Instructions Actually the Thing-O-Matic Ram was printed for my daughter, who, just a day before her birthday mentioned the only gift she wanted was a life sized Corsican ram skull as a decoration for her bedroom. Not one to disappoint I located a nice model at artist-3d.com and proceeded to make a model I could print. After tweaking it to just the head and neck I used ReplicatorG 29r2 to create the gcode. Printing it at it's present size was just under 2.5 hours. This is a one off but I thought others could find a use for a pint-sized ram head.",27183,Wallace Karraker

He possesses a high power radio communications link, which enables him to report back to his home base without having to make a return trip. Lastly, MT Scout's wrists are detachable, which is to allow for different toolings or defense mechanisms, equipping him to be perfectly suited to any mission. This is a work in progress! I'm still working on the legs, neck, and some other things like pins for the joints, etcetera. I AM A COMPLETE NOOB TO THIS PROCESS! So feel free to critique and comment as you see fit, but please, be nice about it. :) Recommended Print Settings: (As I don't have a lot of experience printing, or a 3D printer, these settings are suggestions at best) Smaller Pieces: Shells: 2 Infill: 20-50% (wide range, I know, but what can I say?) Larger Pieces: Shells: 2-3 Infill: 10-30% This is my first go at character design, much less for a 3D printed action figure, so let me know what you think! If somebody wants to print it, I would love to know how it turns out; if you do print it and you run into any hiccups with the model, make sure to let me know! I want to make sure it's easy to print.

0,12155,FigRig camera mount. 300 x 300 bed or larger required,"This allows a 1/4-20 standard tripod screw to be inserted and mount pretty much any camera.
You will need 1x 1/4-20 x 1/2"" screw for the camera mount and 2x 1/4-20 x 3/4"" screws and nuts to attach the handles (22mm grip is optional but I opted for the nice foam style).
Unless you have a very large bed you need to turn the base 45 degrees to fit on a 300x300 bed. A small amount of support is needed since there is a square inset for the handles, I did this to prevent the handles from turning.
The bed should be printed with 60% or greater infill and the handles should be printed at 100% to be sure it's strong enough and not too flexible.
Due to the 3 wide mounting rails you can configure the unit for most any camera, just mount so it feels balanced. Also mount so the lens is centered (like the gopro shown, the lens is off to one side).

0,12243,ButlerTron,"ButlerTron
In order to honor the assistance of mankind in rebuilding the MakerTron population, Remix specifically asked for a design that will serve as a symbol of friendship between the planet Kwota and Earth. As such, the ButlerTron has been created to realize that request.
Head Unit
The immense computing power provided by the head unit enables the ButlerTron to perfectly understand all the communication methods of the Earth. The ButlerTron is therefore capable of conversing in any languages and understand the subtle body language that humans make.
Arm Units
With flexibility and balance in mind, the arm units are created to reflect the maneuverability of human arms. Joints are inserted at key movement points allowing for the shoulder, elbow, and wrist to rotate seamlessly. The Hands are capable of grabbing and releasing motion with the tips acting magnets that can be turned on and off.
Leg Units
These leg units are made to be able to imitate the movement and appearance of human legs as much as possible in order to allow the ButlerTron to not attract too much attention from being a robot. Should the situation calls for it, the leg units can generate a surprising amount of force for greater mobility.
The Suit
The suit is designed and created to give the ButlerTron a more elegance look that fits the human society. Apart from the aesthetic purpose, the suit also acts as a protector for the ever important and vulnerable MakerTron C.O.R.E.; being able to withstand the force of conventional human arms.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Poseable Model
Designed to allow for great amount of movement among joints, the ButlerTron can do a wide variety of poses. Along the arms, a shoulder joint, upper arm joint, elbow joint, and wrist joint are inserted so the model can lift, bend, and rotate his arm freely almost as a human could do. The legs are attached to the body using the hip joint which allow rotation for both straight and side-way. Furthermore, the whole legs can be rotated 360° so that the knees and shoes can be pointed in the desired direction. Also presented are the knee and ankle joints which allow the two corresponding parts to rotate even further.
Printing Orientation and Assembling Parts
The images attached include pictures describing the parts number and the recommended printing orientation to get the best possible result. When assembling all the parts together, there is a picture guide on how to assemble the trickier parts together, the rest of them can be simply attached together according to the pins and holes made.
When printing, it is recommended to have an infill of at least 70% so that all joints are strong and do not break easily when you are posing the model. My print settings can also be seen in the attached picture should any of you be interested.",26093,SwJames
0,12244,MT-20 : Animated Hybrid Robot,"First, watch the video! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QymeqrlsQgI
MT-20 is an animated MakerTron Robot controlled by an Arduino and actuated via 5 servos. If you don't have those items, do not worry! you can still build it, it's an hybrid robot. You simply have to print ""MT20_Servo.stl"" 5 times to replace the real servos.
None of the pieces require support, except ""MT20_Torso.obj"" which only requires a few, and are easily detachable.
It uses Snap-fit ball joints for articulations of legs, arms, hands, and feet.
Head and limbs are designed around the most common micro servo, available here : 5 Mini SG90 Micro 9g Servos
I'm using this Arduino board : Arduino Starter Kit
You can get my Arduino code to control the Servos here : https://github.com/jrbedard/MT20-Robot  It includes animations such as wave, walk, run, etc. You can of course create your own!
Have fun!

I started the project as a basic sketch on paper as a guideline for the overall shapes and key elements. The common techniques include: Topology Brush, Z-Modeler, Deformations-GroupPolish, Clay Polish tab and of course Dynamesh.
Overall the sculpting experience taught me a lot about the natural synergy between Topo Brush and Z-Modeler, being able to find the right normals angle and extrude/bevel was a reliable way to make an intricate multi-layered surface.I'm looking forward to using that technique in the future.
Overall this was a blast of a project to do, hope you enjoyed!",33177,StoianDjongov

Therefore it had to build strength and agility, plus have the tools to start building a new home after the long journey. That's how The Adventurous Tron born. A tron designed for adventure, the recognition of new worlds and with the mission of building a home.
I hope you enjoy the shapes and lines of the design;)
Sorry, I can not advise you technically on the print settings, I haven't a 3D print, so I can't test the model. If anyone is encouraged to print, you'll have to align the pieces with the axes of your 3D printer and you'll have the best result.

With the mouth piece to blow air into a pipe which at the same time restricts inhalation. See figure.1
With the duplicate fitting fitted over the mouth piece to connect two pipes, allowing water flow one way. See figure.2
The two pics (figure 1 and 2) should explain assembly well enough.
This design has been optimised for 3D printing, no support is needed, parts printed separately can be assembled by (click assembly) fitting them together. For the best result : print at 100% infill at any layer height you like, i went 0.2mm. (the full infill will stop leaking possibilities.) I highly recommend using glue on the outer parts after assembly if you were to use it with water and pipes, just to ensure a stronger part as the pressure of water flow might dissasemble fitting from mouth piece.
I included two different sizes for the fittings, for different hose sizes: 3/4 and 5/8 of an inch. The fitting's openings become narrower as the pipe or hose gets inserted deeper, allowing a tight fit. Please use a BB pellet or any small ball you can find to use within the valve. The pellet gets caught by the grid when blown on the valve, allowing flow. But when sucked upon, the pellet will reverse into the opening blocking flow.

0,12271,MAKERTRON-MARK I SUPPORT KIT (FULLY 3D FDM PRINTABLE),"Hello folks.
This is the presentation of Makertron's MARK I SUPPORT KIT!
This KIT is used by Makertrons that who want to take part in simple operations of maintenance.
It is fully UPGRADABLE beacause it has a forearm that has a thread , suitable to screw and unscrew several tools .
This KIT is a base configuaration, but in future it will be developed.
It is composed by:
MAKERTRON-HEAD : This head has MULTICORE-CPU that adds the ability to see, speak, and listen, while also providing additional computing power to make the MakerTron smarter than if they didn’t have a head. With specific augmentations like excellent vision( even X-RAY vision), translation skills, acute hearing and large amounts of computing power, certain MakerTron become experts in areas such as security, diplomacy and research. In this case is MAINTENANCE area.
 MAKERTRON-SX ARM: Arms provide a way for the MakerTron to physically interact with and manipulate their environment. Balancing strength with dexterity and the ability to attach specific tools to their arms, a wide variety of jobs can be filled in thanks to thread put in its forearm. In SX ARM case it has a mandrel screwed on its forearm  that allows it to use tools to perform foraure . The hole that it can carry depends on the tip that it may include in its should send . It has a set of tips on staying a bit holder placed around the forearm armor . At the basic level it has a tool kit consists of 3 spikes . The spindle allows a drilling precision equal to 80 % . In the future we hope to implement the tool of laser cutter in the MARK II of this kit , so as to assure a pressure that workmanship equal to 99-100 % .
MAKERTRON-DX ARM: The right hand works the same way the left . But it has the task of carrying out support to the left arm . For example in the replacement of the drill bit. The clamp that holds it is critical in these operations , but also allows moving or lifting objects with an accuracy of 60 % . In KIT MARK II the intention will be to develop the laser cutter , which makes it independent from the same right arm . It will be possible to install a new tool or a hand that allows an accuracy of 100%.
MAKETRON-ROCKET LEGS: A MakerTron is heavily dependent on it’s legs for mobility and transportation.  In this case legs are the same thing with the rockets. They're powerd by C.O.R.E. energy that permit it to reach a supersonic speed.  The design of them is made to lean on the rockets. In MARK II we provide to devise a foothold position betterand  add afterburner to improve speed and reach a fantastic speed!!!
MAKERTRON-WINGS : Wings are made to stabilize correct the trajectory of flight. Them support supersonic flight and also act as a shield. 
We suggest some instructions of printed divided in two Cura's sets. Structure Sets:
INFILL -Shell Tickness: 0.8 mm -Top/bottom Thickness: 0.8 mm -Infill overlap: 15% -Infill pattern: Grid Check infill top solid check infill bottom solid
SUPPORT -Support Pattern: Lines -Overhang angle: 43° -Fill density: 5% -XY distance. 0.7 mm -Z distance: 0.15 mm
SKIRT AND BRIM -Skirt Line: 0 -skirt distance 2
Extrusion sets: General check enable retraction check perimeter before -Retraction speed: 40 mm/s -Retraction distance: 4 mm -Minimum shift before retraction :1.5 mm -Minimum Extrusion before retraction: 0.1mm -Z Hop: 0 mm -Base object Cut off: 0 mm -nozzle diameter: 0.4 mm minimizes crossing parameters: Always

0,12275,MakerTron A.R.K. (Autonomous Rover Companion),"A.R.C. (Autonomous Rover Companion) is the newest generation companion for the MakerTron Race. A.R.C. 's play a multirole part in the rebuilding of the MakerTron population. They are designed to be companions like a loyal dog, and they can follow commands. They are quite capable across multiple terrains and conditions due to their adaptive configuration. There are three core configurations. They can be compact to fit into different spaces for the purposes of exploration or storage. They can fully extend their limbs for traversing more treacherous terrain or to reach high areas. They can also go into high speed mode in which they can use their wheels to quickly get over vast distances. Their head also detaches from the body and becomes an aerial drone for quick recon and exploration helping them to efficiently and quickly find resources. A.R.C. 's are thoughtful companions, they like to play and have a very curious nature. Regular MakerTrons have been known to hitch a ride on their backs at times as well.
There is some assembly required, but I added instructions on how it goes together in one of the images.  I hope you guys like it, it can do quite a few things. 
The head: is detachable and has wings which open up to function as  quad copter thrusters. 
Torso: Standard MakerTron Torso
Arms: Are fully extendable/retractable and feature hands that open into functional claws or fold up to use the built in wheels
Legs: Are fully extendable/retractable and feature feet or fold out to use the built in wheels

0,12299,Arc - The Forgotten One,"Story - Arc is a scout unit of the MakerTron species , sent many years ago to gather information on unknown planets. Arc’s last mission was to recon planet Earth for any intelligent life. Nearing the end of the mission, Arc was preparing for a journey back to his home planet of Kwota. Unfortunately, Arc did not calculate for a large meteor to come into collision with Earth. This did not end well for the reptilian species on Earth and Arc. Damaged in the massive meteor collision, Arc had to be placed in a low powered state until another MakerTron would come into proximity of earth. Many years have passed, until finally Remix made contact with people on Earth. Sensing that another MakerTron was around Earth’s proximity, Arc finally awoke from his hibernation to come into contact with Remix in hopes of repair. Unfortunately, Remix informed him of what has happened to Kwota. Now Arc’s mission is to help rebuild the MakerTron species and provide what information is left on Arc’s databanks.
Arc:
Top - The top is made up of jets and is the main form of transportation for scout MakerTrons. There are 4 engines that make up the top, and a main power generator in the middle. The jets allow for quick mobility and the ability to fly thus making it perfect for a MakerTron to recon and gather information.
Guns - Arc has been equipped with two guns, one for each side, in the case of unexpected conflict. The guns fire plasma bullets at a fast rate. The guns are not meant for large battles or targets as a scout mainly runs away for its defensive maneuver.
Bottom - Arc is designed to scout and collect information. The large, rotatable eye is meant to scan the area quickly. This helps Arc see and gather valuable information about his surrounds, such as material composition and their properties. The eye also houses a large databank to hold all the information.
Printing Instructions:
Supports are needed. 
The design uses the cylinders from the original Remix MakerTron design. This is only needed for the arms and legs cylinders.
The Jet Arm will need to be printed 4 times. The Jet Arm will be able to fit into the Main Jet. Optionally you can glue the arms into the Jet.
Design does not require any glue!

0,12357,MakerTron OMNIUS,"Overview
The MakerTron ""Omnius"" kit is designed to combine every aspect of life as a space faring robot and refine them into an attractive and efficient model. After all, every life-form needs three things:mobility, utility, and artillery.
These three aspects have been covered in various ways throughout the three primary sections of the kit. These sections are the lower body, arms, and head; covered in greater detail below, based on the full articulation kit.
Many forms and changes took place throughout the design process, so the models are sorted by the amount of articulations. The default print is easy print (with neck and shoulder attachments on a higher infill), but with a higher resolution printer, the full articulation kit is made for complete realism of movement. Disclaimer: I use a public printer, so while I did try printing and retesting certain joints, it may require slight scaling.
Lower body
With independent lateral rotation, the lower body boasts extremely high control and opens the possibility for gyroscopic stability of the torso, making any maneuver a piece of cake without hampering the task at hand. Designed for traversing mountainous terrain and even scaling flat walls with sharp tips for anchoring support-- after all, why not make full use of the self-healing polymer tech in their space ships anyway? But don't think that stops these legs from moving quickly along flat-lands, hills, and even ice! The legs were designed to be able to be folded in and shuffled across ice (which obviously isn't made for load-bearing) to decrease the PSI.
Arms
In any even vaguely humanoid life-form, the arms are the pinnacle of offense and often in utilities in interacting with it's environment. These arms originally were considered to handle close range combat, however these are not the mainline defense though, as MakerTron civilization is A) largely peaceful and B) far more advanced than melee combat, so they were left out of the final design. Sparring is of course important for tactics and training, but the real weapons systems come from the arm-mounted lasers that are capable of generating lasers with enough focus to drill and weld-- which is far more than would be needed for eliminating hostile organics. Lower levels of laser can be used for broad-range spectroscopy (a wider range of sight) and hologram generation for communications. The hands simply specialize in grasping and manipulating objects within arms' reach, no matter the shape or size. They achieve this by using a hing the median axis of the hand, freeing the wrist but constrain the lateral motion for optimal grasping, which was originally intended to be two ball joints, but proved easier to assemble with a ball joint and a hinge.
Head
The head has two primary sense functions: sight and sound. The ears are modeled to resemble an owl's satellite dish-shaped ""ears"" that funnel in sound. The microphones are offset by 5 microns to detect the distance from the source of the sound in the event that it was directly in front or behind the MakerTron. For the vision, the left eye see broad-spectrum light to generate depth perception, the right eye rotates to alternate between infrared, visible light, and ultraviolet. The benefits of this are that infrared can be used for heat imaging, ultraviolet can capture even private signals, and visible light allows for detection of physical obstacles. 
How I Designed This
Inspiration
The legs were inspired by a Klann linkage and and a classic video game, ""Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door,"" with it's character Mimi. Those spider legs could burn themselves into anyone's mind.
The arms were originally intended to be inspired by Astuma's right arm in ""Enchanted Arms,"" but took it's own shape based on the MakerTron's torso. The finite details still pay some homage though.
The head is more military based, with a sci-fi twist. Imagine spec-ops meet ""Halo: ODST"" and that's pretty much my idea going in.

0,12361,C.H.I.E.F. - Fireman MakerTron,"Who is C.H.I.E.F.?
When Remix of the MakerTron came to me for help I really wanted to make sure that I created a design that he could be proud of. I worked closely with Remix throughout the redesign of this MakerTron. His only request was that I make a MakerTron that could help the people that were helping to save his species from extinction.  During his visit to earth, Remix had been learning about us. I noticed as I was brainstorming that he seemed to be very intrigued by our obsession with superheros. This nearly swayed me to create BatMakerTron, SuperMakerTron, or HULK MakeSMASHTron! But then it quickly became obvious to me what needed to happen. I told Remix about the real life heroes we have on Earth. I told him about policemen, the armed services and the firemen. I told him about people that risk their lives every day, so that we can live in peace and comfort. Just as Remix risked his existence to save the last remaining C.O.R.E.s of his people, C.H.I.E.F will help to save human and MakerTron alike. The MakerTron before your eyes is more than just a friendly robot. This MakerTron is a hero!
C.H.I.E.F. is equipped with the jaws of life to cut away the wreckage of burning vehicles to free people trapped inside. He has a fire-hose nozzle attached to his left arm, as well as the hefty metal frame that allows him to single-handedly replace an entire team of fireman at the hydrant.  The coil-over shocks in his legs allow him to jump from a five story window of a burning building with a person in his arms. He is equipped with ham radio, GPS, infrared sensors, thermal imaging array, and life detection sensor technology (a contribution from Remix). His large humanoid hands allow him to carefully cradle a human being while he runs through the flames of disaster. All of his components are made from a heat resistant nickel-based alloy clad with tungsten, lending his componentry a melting point of over 6,000 degrees Fahrenheit! This is the bionic hero you want on your side in the face of impending doom!
Print Settings
It is often hard to suggest print settings when you have no idea what machine the people you are trying to help have at their disposal. That being said, if I were to print C.H.I.E.F. at work (which is unfortunately forbidden) I would use  the following settings.
 Layer Height: 0.1mm
Shell Thickness: 0.8mm
Bottom/Top Thickness: 0.8
Fill Density: 20%
Print Speed: 50 mm/s
This is for an Ultimaker 2 printer. I like to use PLA (we use Gizmo Dorks Filament) and a Nozzle temperature of 210 deg C. For this model I would use touching buildplate support type (The springs in the legs may need support everywhere). You may want to lower the lower arms into the buildplate a bit since they are spherical on the bottom.  
P.S. The core was not designed by me. It is from the MakerTron Design Contest. I downloaded the file and uploaded it with the model, so you don't have to search for it when printing. Thanks to Mold3D and pinshape for putting together this awesome contest!!!",26390,The JakeL

All pins are fused in the parts but the one for the legs to give them better grip and mobility. The design has elements that identify the system as unique. Decorations are the same on the parts making them a unique style.
Printing
This can be printed at 0.2 layer height and with and infill of 5-10%. Wall size can be made sturdy by adding more loops. I advice around 1mm (on a 0.4mm noozzle should be fine 2 loops, can be increased to 3). Supports must be used, create them with automatic settings or in Meshmixer-like software. The parts are left side of the body must be mirrored to get the right side.
Story of the toy
As you can see MakerTrons are rebuild with different features. The classic setup will have 2 styles: speed and strong.
Speed is a very fast bot with light structure and good agility.
Strong is a heavy duty bot for big jobs around.
But Makerbots are smart and they can use two ways, personalize and combine, to have even more power. They can choose 4 different heads that provide them skills over the limbs they choose. Or they can have a combination with different parts. They share the connection so a STR series can be easily connect to a SPD series to make a new powerful limb that shares part of the skills of the two series.
The barrels and round covers on the limbs hides the technology of the MakerTrons and make the different parts have theirs own characteristics. See the pictures for detailed description of the single parts.",31507,Lord M

Laser cannons suit it well. To enlight furthermore its inhumanity their dimensions also reminds the shape of a chimpanzee-like creature.
Soldiers have to march. So, I got inspired by the relentless marches of armies on the battlefield. This robot's boots are inequivocally studied to take their owner in only one direction: to war! Its knees deserve a particular mention: I was inspired by the bulbous bow of a war ship.
The head is the emblem of this robot: why we need to protect its head with an helmet, when the head could become an helmet itself? The eyes were a difficult choice, but in the end I decided to remove them. In this way I can consolidate the idea of the soulless tool.

0,12396,MechanicTron's Arm,"Made more to look good than to function, although at a glance, several parts appear to be able to flex and rotate.
The arm was designed with several holes in the upper and lower arm to (presumably) hold tools. The holes were dimensioned for if this was a human-size robot, so about 1:6. (Sorry to anyone who wanted to put real screwdriver bits in the lower arm.) If this were a real robot, many parts would be able to rotate freely, and all joints would be able to flex with the visible overlapping plates. With both arms, the MakerTron should be able to reach over to grab tools from its other arm, with the upper and lower arms freely spinning. The fingers and thumb are flat towards the inside for better tool and part grasping. As a fix-it man myself, I know I'd want that. (Since these are futuristic robots, I didn't include doors for the arm holes. I figure the tools could be magnetized or the robot could have force field doors or something.) It only has three fingers because I never use my pinkie for fix-it jobs and I know a few people who can type faster than me and don't use their pinkies.
I couldn't open the part files included in the contest download, so I only have the arm for you. It does fit in the arm hole, though. For printing, I heavily recommend using a second material for support.

0,12414,Grumpy French Chef,"Quality Chefatron 2000, a little bit more whimsical take on the MegaTron.
Why a chef robot ? Why not. Who doesn't like good food. 
For print I recommend 0.1 mm with 20% infill. Most models need no or little support. Good adhesion to the print bad is a must because of the nature of the designs to print with no supports. I recommend blue tape with Isopropyl alcohol rub for extra grip. 
Good cooling system highly recommended because some parts of the print are 60 degrees incline. 
For the parts that need support I found that setting to 60 degrees overhand works well.
For the ball joints to fit properly make sure the extrusion is calibrated , under extrusion or over extrusion will make the ball joints not fit , worse case scenario you can glue them in the pose that you like. ",33823,Kedlaw

0,12416,DRILL MASTER Carpenter Robot,"Quality finish carpentry is an art dominated mainly by manual work and often pieces need to be duplicated, which becomes a tedious process. The goal of this robot design is to create a machine that can learn a woodworking process, either by process observation, or object scanning, and then re-create what it observed. It can also receive a program via a blue tooth receiver in its head. The robot has a magnetic utility belt allowing it to increase its efficiency. Under its safety shield on the head it has 3D laser scanner allowing it to create a 3D image to operate from. Each of the ball joints are driven by internal motors which allow full articulation and free movement. 
Attachments:
The robot is designed to be modular and versatile in the tools it can use, and the four attachments included are not the only attachments it is capable of using. the forearms have a rotating hex socket which has electrical and pneumatic contacts inside which attachments can use for power as needed.

0,12419,Multiverse Makertron Pack,"The story:
Please watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVUsICQdHnw
Here is the script from the story:
Multiverse Maker Tron
Our story begins on the planet kwota a short time in the future. Makertron was assigned to an offworld mission when the sun exploded! boom! As the shockwaves from the supernova blast wash over him, all his body parts are blown away. Makertron realizes that all his friends and family living on Kwota are dead. The gamma rays from the explosion have damaged space time itself, allowed makertron to travel through the multiverse..who will he encounter next?
A dimension wave washes over Makertron. He is lost in the turbulence. He manages to grab a propeller as it goes by. He figures he should find a way to hold onto it so he make a simple holder under his neck. He is not sure what the propeller is good for but he knows it will be useful.
The wave continues to suck through the infinite universes. He lands in a desert place. He meets a race of humans smell bad and don’t ever seem to take baths. They don’t use money even though they all have plenty of it and they also burn “the man” every time their tiny blue planet rotates around their sun. These burning people give MakerTron a new head as a gift with a fully functioning goggle sensor package.
Another dimension slash time wave suckes makertron all the way back to world war 2. He does not like all the fighting and killing, but he is able to scan a copy of these sweet half track-tank treads which he likes a lot.
The terminator visites maker tron. Makertron is scared, and gets away, but not before he steals the arms from the T800 model robot. Makertron loves his arms, especially because he can hold stuff like the propeller he found earlier.
A wave comes. Makertron is changed somehow…..oh look! it’s an accessory port! Now makertron can hold stuff on his back without that hacky neck adapter. He also findes...the KRAGLE! he knows this will be useful for repairing failed 3D printed parts.
The next dimension wave leaves makertron a little confused. He meets these shell creatures who spend their entire lives in the sewer just eating pizza.
Nearing the end of his journeys Makertron decides that he needs to copy the drone fad that the humans are so excited about. Finally a usage for that propeller he’s been holding onto the whole time! Finally makertron can maneuver around in the atmosphere with ease. With all his parts complete makertron can live happily ever after.
Instructions:
Steampunk head: print upright, with supports on.
Half track from ww2:
Print with the front of the wheels facing up. Print two of this model, it works for both left and right. If you are having filament issues, or having what I call “fuzzy layers” (usually it’s a partial jam). Print this vertically.
Quad-copter backpack:
Print upside down, with all the connector arm in the air.
Ninja Turtle backpack:
Print with the flat part of the backpack down on the table. There is a slight tilt due to the attachment pin, but this is ok.
Blades:
print two copies of the ""CW_CCW"" file, do them in different colors!

0,12420,TronBuilder,"The TronBuilder's main purpose is for putting together other MakerTrons. It fashions an interchangeable tool system of tool mounts attached to it's arms, allowing it to change between tools as it is needed for different jobs. These tools include, are not limited to, welding torches, laser cutters, laser drills, power claws, and power drills. This allows the TronBuilder to rebuild the MakerTron Population with ease!
Design:
The loadout used in this design of the TronBuilder includes the welding torch, laser cutter, and power claw. The torch and cutter are both mounted on the right arm, while the claw is mounted on the left. This setup allows the TronBuilder to clamped down on large pieces with one arm while cutting or welding them together with the other arm. 
On the front side of the hip are built in lights so the TronBuilder can work even in dark environments. On the back side there are two batteries hooked up to his core to power his heavy duty equipment. ",29455,PauPauDragon

0,12441,Palmiga Globe Bouquet Vase - Pillar-base,"This base was designed to be fitted on my Globe Bouquet Vase so that it can be placed on a pillar/pole in the garden...
I designed my Globe Bouquet Vase as a miniature protest against all the 3D printed vases that focuses on the actual vase ;)
It´s fun and nice to see the creativity designing the most complex 3D printed vase but isn't the flowers the main attraction and also the most beautiful? No 3D print can come close to that beauty right?
My vase was designed to blend in... to showcase the flowers by helping to form a Globe Bouquet. Don´t get me wrong... I of course still wanted the design to be somewhat appealing on its own and I do think the end result is a good compromise.
Obviously it´s designed to be printed without support and it´s possible to scale down a bit to fit lots of printers (174 mm x 179 mm x 159 mm at 100%). In my pictures and movies it´s printed at 80% with 0.2mm layers and a 0.7mm nozzle. Combined with the base part and a pillar it´s a good start creating a parkway framed with elevated Globe Bouquets... (base printed at 70% in the picture)
The outer holes together with the holes in the inner geometry creates endless combinations when arranging the flowers.
If one does not like the flower aspect I guess it would double great at Comic Con as the top of a Wizard Staff or Alien Weaponry perhaps?
I challenge everyone to make a creative base for the Globe Bouquet Vase so that it can morph into something completely new ;) No rules... and the price is fame, glory and hopefully pride :- )
The lowest 2mm of the vase is available here http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1060145 as a STEP-file so that you easily can design your own unique base...
The vase it self is available as a free download here:https://www.myminifactory.com/object/palmiga-globe-bouquet-vase-13379 but is also part of the ""Support free Vase & Planter Design competition""
thus it´s now available for only $9.99 during the competition (compared to the standard $39)

One October as a kid, my friends and I decided we were too old for Halloween and wouldn’t make costumes that year. In those days you didn’t buy a costume, you made it yourself and that was half the fun. When Halloween actually rolled along, we gather sadly at my house with nothing to do but help my Mother by eating large amounts of her ‘ready-to-hand-out’ candy. Sensing our plight, and maybe to get back in charge of the Halloween candy, my Mother handed us a stack of old sheets and blankets with orders to “go out and patrol the neighborhood, and don’t cut any holes.”
That was one of the most fun Halloweens I can remember. High on sugar we dawned sheets, haunting the neighborhood and scaring every little kid within several blocks, laughing all the way. Now I can imagine what we would have looked like as the spooky South Park crew.
Instructions
Print at 0.2mm, 15% in fill, with support. I usedthe 45% 2mm automatic support with S3D for the example prints. You could getaway with less support depending on your printer. IMPORTANT- in S3D, on the FFF settings, ‘Advanced’ tab under ‘Slicing Behavior’, please check “Merge all outlines into a single solid model”. Even though the model is water tight and manifold, the simulated cloth surface tends to cross itself on tight folds and can cancel itself out creating a rip.

Sensing our plight, and maybe to get back in charge of the Halloween candy, my Mother handed us a stack of old sheets and blankets with orders to “go out and patrol the neighborhood, and don’t cut any holes.”
That was one of the most fun Halloweens I can remember. High on sugar we dawned sheets, haunting the neighborhood and scaring every little kid within several blocks, laughing all the way. Now I can imagine what we would have looked like as the spooky South Park crew.
Instructions
Print at 0.2mm, 15% in fill, with support. I usedthe 45% 2mm automatic support with S3D for the example prints. You could getaway with less support depending on your printer. IMPORTANT- in S3D, on the FFF settings, ‘Advanced’ tab under ‘Slicing Behavior’, please check “Merge all outlines into a single solid model”. Even though the model is water tight and manifold, the simulated cloth surface tends to cross itself on tight folds and can cancel itself out creating a rip. This setting will prevent the problem.",17368,richard_swika

0,12483,Plus Minus Facade Tile,"Plus Minus 3D printed facade tile uses negative and positive space to create a wall facade tile with a double purpose. When used upright, the negative space within the tiles become planters with drains that connect them vertically. If used downright (turned 180 degrees), the triangular surfaces protect the wall from direct solar radiation. The inner negative space create air pockets that allow heat to escape upwards through the drain openings. Since the tile is a square profile, both configurations could also used together. Winner of People's Choice Award (2nd Place) at 3DPrintFacade Competition in Amsterdam.
Design incudes internal drains. Can be mounted on a wall using double-sided tape, it also stands by itself.

How to assemble? Watch the video (link above) + 2 details that are missing on the video 1. Rather glue 2 clock pieces together (not necessary) 2.

You will need to find two small suction cups (these can be bought very cheaply from Amazon or eBay). Superglue the suckers into the retaining bar, fit it onto the bottom section of the tidy but leave it unglued (for now). Hook the unit onto your shower unit and then move the bar to stick the suckers onto the wall. You can now glue it but it's not compulsory, do whatever you feel is best.

0,12522,Star 6 Puzzle,"A simple 6 piece puzzle making a faceted 3D star shape. Easy to print without support. A difficulty of only about 2 out of 10 to solve, however surprisingly beautiful when assembled. Demonstrates the precision of 3D printing by making a tight and void free solid rivaling anything that could ever be hand made from wood. Small enough to print with filament scraps and free samples in a mix of colors.
Scalable – easier to handle and solve when made larger, more fun when made smaller (IMHO). Complete puzzle prints in under 40 minutes [on my printer] at the supplied scale and costs about $0.5 in material.
Instructions
I’ve provided the puzzle as a complete build plate with all the parts needed to make one complete puzzle. I’ve also provided each piece as a separate file so you can print in many colors using all those scraps and free samples you have laying around, before they go bad. In this case, to make 1 puzzle, print 1 copy of piece 1 (no cuts), 2 copies of piece 2 (3 cuts), and 3 copies of piece 3 (2 cuts). Scale for the difficulty level as explained below. Your choice.
IMPORTANT: Scale 133% (large puzzle in photos) for a relatively easy puzzle, simply because it will be easier to handle and will stay together under its own weight when partially assembled, where the smaller ones may not stay together when partially assembled and take more precision just to handle; scale at 66% (small puzzle in photos) for a harder puzzle. Print as supplied for an average difficulty puzzle (middle puzzle in photos).
Print at 0.2 mm, no support, 10% in-fill for the larger size, and 15 to 20% for the smaller sizes. I also used 4 perimeters and 4 layers top and bottom for strength. I’ve noticed a difference in the amount of in-fill required based on the quality of the filament, with better quality filament requiring less in-fill. So ultimately, experiment, these are just starting points.

0,12639,Wind Energy Stored In Gravity,"Summary Wind Energy Stored In Gravity The challenge Design a 3D model that harnesses the power of the wind. Technology connections Energy transfer, movable assemblies. The idea This model demonstrates a fairly new idea that is being used in the field of renewable energy: Storing energy from wind and solar in gravity. This simple solution eliminates the need for expensive and environmentally unfriendly batteries. We can use generated energy to lift heavy objects and later retrieve the energy using the weight of the lifted object to turn gears on its way back down. A gravity battery is considered full when the heavy object is lifted all the way up. Real world implementations of this concept usually involve weights that are either lowered into deep holes in the ground or held in above ground silos. How it works Energy is generated using a vertical wind turbine on the lefthand side. There is a movable battery section in the middle that can be adjusted left or right to charge or expend the gravity battery. On the right side, there is a fan that can be used to reproduce the summer breeze after it is caught and stored in the battery. Multiple copies of the rack gear can be glued together to increase the storage capacity of the battery indefinitely. There is a small release lever on the top left of the movable battery area that keeps the gears moving in one direction. I’m using 8x7x22mm ball bearings to make all of the parts turn smoothly: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BBGTK6 Video: http://youtu.be/l1YajkmqFpw and https://youtu.be/9IRc9xG2ers Here is a video of Bill Gates talking about gravity energy storage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH5Lgv-4te8 Check out http://www.gravitybattery.info/ for a great illustration of a proposed home use solution. Mini version of the vertical wind turbine: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:971564 Instructions I've included full models of the turbine and fan in addition to sliced versions for easier printing. You can reduce the number of fan blades, reverse them, or attach a motor/anything else you'd like. I recommend printing in ABS with .2 layer height and 30% fill. The rack gears function as the battery weight, so it might be a good idea to print them at 100% fill, and/or attach additional weight to the gear to increase torque.

0,12641,The Catfish - A fully working submarine,"Summary A fully working submarine created for the Thingiverse #MakeItFloat challenge. I'd like to eventually get a fish finder on it and have it map lake beds. Reviews: ""a fun, unique design"" - Derek Bower ""this is an incredible build"" - omega-00 3DPrint.com article: http://3dprint.com/81607/3d-printed-mini-submarine/ Inspiration My initial inspiration for this sub came from this boat: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:272132 I had a fishing trip planned and always wanted a RC boat to play with while out on the lake. I didn’t have the necessary hardware on hand to get the propeller setup going or the time needed to order parts, so I modified the boat to fit this water pump: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:537649 Here is a newer version of that pump, modified by me: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:883212 Once out on the lake, I tied some fishing line to it for a tether and attached a hook with some bait to the bottom. It caught a catfish! He was a small little guy and was released back into the lake. While it was a success (it caught a fish!), the boat did have some problems taking on water. Any amount of motion in the water was enough to splash, flood, and sink the thing. The centrifugal pump also needed to be primed to get it pumping, so a future version of the boat would need a second priming pump. To keep the boat from flooding I would need to put a top of some sort on it. A flat top offered little space for electronics and anything decorative would surely need to serve a second purpose housing motors or other parts. At that point I was thinking about just printing out a second boat, flipping it upside down and gluing them together. Well, now it looks like a submarine. I then found the MakeItFloat challenge and decided to go full speed ahead with a more complicated, STEM related project. This project takes science, technology, engineering, and even a bit of math to create a fully working submarine. I’ve learned some things and I hope you will too! Submarines can control their own buoyancy, making them float or sink at will. Archimedes’ principle An object will sink if it weighs more than the water it displaces. An object will float if it weighs less than the water it displaces. Imagine you have an empty soda bottle with the cap screwed on tightly and you took it down to the bottom of a lake and released it. Since the bottle is filled with air, it will quickly float up to the top of the lake with an amount of force equal to the weight of the water that is displaced by the bottle. The amount of weight needed to sink an empty soda bottle (filled with air) = the weight of a soda bottle filled with water. Submarines control their depth by adjusting how much air and water is stored in internal ballast tanks. There are holes in the bottom that are always open to allow water to freely enter and exit. To surface (float), air is pumped into the tank to pressurize it, forcing water out through the bottom. When it is time to submerge (sink), air is released from the tank, allowing water to enter through the bottom to fill up the tank. Submarines pump air into the ballast tanks, but from where? The answer is additional highly pressurized air tanks. I do not recommend mixing highly pressurized gasses and/or liquids with 3D printed parts. An alternate solution that could work is CO2 cartridges. Again, you would want to make sure all parts used are made to the proper specs for that much pressure. I have not found any viable air compressor solution that would be small enough to pressurize metal air tanks inside the submarine while it is at the surface, so I’ve come up with another solution: A float/bobber that sits above the water surface with an air tube running down to the submarine’s internal air pump. We’ll call this the “float deck”. This float deck can also take care of another problem which is wireless communication. Even an inch of water is enough to kill wireless signals and we can use the float to keep the antenna out of the water to maintain a clear line-of-sight. Alternatively, we could limit our wireless communication to only happen when the sub has surfaced, submerging to do autonomous missions offline. Overview: This submarine has 3 pumps, 2 servos, and 1 additional DC motor: Main propulsion (centrifugal) pump http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:883212 Second water pump for priming the first pump http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D82W60O Diaphragm air pump for surfacing http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008SNYG9C Rudder servo (left/right direction control) Air valve servo: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:138112 DC motor for reeling in the float deck (a small motor pulled from a cd-rom drive) The submerge procedure would go like this: Open the air valve to allow air to escape so it can fill up with water. Close the air valve when the desired depth has been reached. The surface procedure would go like this: With the air valve closed, pump air into the sub until it has enough buoyancy to return to the surface. You might also choose to reel in the float deck while surfacing. The air pump will need to overcome the pressure of the water surrounding the submarine to push the water out. The deeper you go, the more pressure there will be. You will need to experiment with how deep you can actually go before the air pump is no longer effective.

0,12737,Air wind generator Blade,"Wind power is extracted from air flow using wind turbines or sails to produce mechanical or electrical power. Windmills are used for their mechanical power, windpumps for water pumping, and sails to propel ships. Wind power as an alternative to fossil fuels, is plentiful, renewable, widely distributed, clean, produces no greenhouse gas emissions during operation, and uses little land.[2] The net effects on the environment are far less problematic than those of nonrenewable power sources.
Wind farms consist of many individual wind turbines which are connected to the electric power transmission network. Onshore wind is an inexpensive source of electricity, competitive with or in many places cheaper than coal or gas plants.[3][4][5] Offshore wind is steadier and stronger than on land, and offshore farms have less visual impact, but construction and maintenance costs are considerably higher. Small onshore wind farms can feed some energy into the grid or provide electricity to isolated off-grid locations.[6]
Wind power is very consistent from year to year but has significant variation over shorter time scales. It is therefore used in conjunction with other electric power sources to give a reliable supply. As the proportion of windpower in a region increases, a need to upgrade the grid, and a lowered ability to supplant conventional production can occur.[7][8] Power management techniques such as having excess capacity, geographically distributed turbines, dispatchable backing sources, sufficient hydroelectric power, exporting and importing power to neighboring areas, using vehicle-to-grid strategies or reducing demand when wind production is low, can in many cases overcome these problems.[9][10] In addition, weather forecasting permits the electricity network to be readied for the predictable variations in production that occur.",35139,Eduardo Firvida

Hints Best way to make liquid composition is to use 6 parts water 2 parts dish soap 1 part sugar or glycerine and slowly mix it without making bubbles. The parts where liquid stay is about 160 ml volume so, based on above hint, I've put 125 ml water + 25 ml dish soap + 1 sugar teaspoon.

0,12792,Walking Elephant 3D Zoetrope,"Summary Video of zoetrope in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_E09L5mKf18 These are 3D models of working 3D zoetrope. There are 10 poses of walking elephant. In this version I used stepper motor and LED strobe light controlled by arduino. I'm planning to improve design in the future. The best effect can be observed in the dark, ambient light will add motion smudges. The elephants print better upside down, they need to be resized to scale of 0.3 (sorry, forgot to do that before exporting to STL). The elephants then need to be glued to the inserts using glue gun and then inserted into the disk. The trick is to align the animals in the same order, 01 to 10. If some poses don't align, a head gun can be used to melt the glue and re-adjust pose correspondingly. The purpose of inserts is to be able to use different animations on the same rig. However you can glue the elephants to the disk, in this case no need to print the inserts.

This is a preliminary version of my Bowden MK7 Extruder, suitable for Rostok, Prusa i3, etc. I derived this from another Bowden extruder for MK8 pulley. I completely remade it from scratch, is parametric but not compatible with the 3mm filament, due to 4OD 2ID push fit I use. Not printed yet (I'm printing it in this very moment, but no images ready yet) so I don't know if it is functional. If someone want to test it, print the idler and the extruder with 95-100% infill for durability. It's been designed with Inventor LT 2013 and quite tested for tolerances and resistance. Possibly I'll modify the idler to make it more strong against torsion due to hard filament pressure against the ball bearing.

After printing, gently peel off the build bed and twist/wrap it around a pencil or dowel rod to shape. Working it like a spring pushing/pulling it back and forth and twisting it counterclockwise you can reshape it as needed.

For use on extruders with idler bar spring assemblies that modify filament feed tension.

0,12870,Daemon Prince Behemoth,"Summary Chaos Daemon Prince Behemoth Reduced @100k faces, printed in about 3 hours. Model height ~3.75"" with a 4.5"" wing span. Needs full use of support. Printed it rotated with wings flat as possible to the platform; even with supports the wings would fail when printing the model vertically in a standing position - ymmv. Support model included as well; printed the final large test model using Simplify3D as the slicer. There are some issues with the carapace on the back of the neck and the gauntlet on the right hand; at times it prints hollow/spotty even though the internal model and wireframe skeleton doesn't indicate any issues; there are some hidden internal geometry that could be the culprit or issues from scaling down the model in my initial test. I went ahead and included the gauntlet and carapace as separate .stl files for download if you want to include them in the model if it doesn't completely print out for you. Print them after the fact and glue them on. I'm using this for a new Nurgle force so I don't mind some of the missing elements from the print - it just looks like rotten/ripped flesh and bone structure... The picture has Behemeth wearing this crown - thing:31928. It's truncated in the model and doesn't completely print at this scale anyways. I will end up adding some horns/spikes from my bits bin. The complete crown model is not included with this model but you can get it on Thingiverse if you want to try another method of printing it out and adding it separately - for some reason they decided to not allow remixes of this crown design http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:31928 I can't find the original source of the chaos base; if anyone recognizes it please let me know so I can attribute the original author on this build. In the end I swapped out the scorpion tale with a metal OOP GW piece from my Tyranid bits bin; works great as a proxy model for Be'lakor.

0,12871,Floating LED Photo Frame,"Summary Remixed the photo frame to integrate it with backlit LED(s); Depending on how you want it back-lit, you can use a single LED (center) or two (left/right). It should all friction fit although PLA required some sanding. Prints without support. You can glue the LED bridge to the frame if needed to keep the arms from expanding out. To use two LEDs: Option 1 - put the two LEDs on the LED bridge, to the left and right of the battery making sure your polarity is correct and insert cap apply enough pressure turn it on. Option 2 - insert LEDs into side bar then interweave into CR2025/CR2032 battery and insert cap to turn it on. This way you could slide the LED bridge out to turn it off or swap out LEDs colors a little easier. The LED leads I use are long enough so I don't need to solder any wires unless you put the LEDs on the furthest part of the side bar. Single battery should last up to 2-3 weeks - orange and red LEDs should use a resistor; this is intended for an always on gallery/showcase installation - designing a real switch element would be ideal however that would probably require you to do some soldering and/or some redesign of the base/cap to avoid soldering although could include a mini-breadboard on the back side if it didn't weigh it all down too much...",33969,onebitpixel
0,12872,25mm to XXmm Base Expanders,"Summary To rebase or not to rebase... I do not particularly like the look of gluing a smaller base on top of a larger base; even if you add scenic elements to hide the old base, the added height just doesn't look right (not to mention that changes the line of sight by an additional 3.5mm; although cover saves are now shorter by 3.5mm - lol) When you somehow managed to accumulate a bag of 400 or so older 25mm bases around it doesn't hurt to repurpose them to the slightly larger base size as needed - and the fancy, top/front heavy metal models appreciate the more stable base dimensions. These are beveled on the inside to fit the generic/Citadel/GW beveled bases. Print 2x for each base; prints in about 4-8 minutes (depending on which dimension you choose and your printer setting). Prints without support. Fits snuggly around the base of existing model to expand it to 32mm or 40mm. Includes a partially open (hit)marker ring for 25mm bases.",33969,onebitpixel

0,12874,The Lantern - Warhammer Quest,"Summary Warhammer Quest; Bogoff's lantern proxy for Lair of the Orc Lord We use an old Warhammer snotling ammo grunt miniature to carry the lantern. Prints without support; hollow to allow a small LED element. The wires runs through the top of the model, wrapped into a small loop like a rope along the backside then down the leg into the base where the battery is placed - it lights up when the miniature is set upright. Basic Yellow; 200mcd; 465mm; 2.5V Watch Battery; 3V DL1216 More info about Lair of the Orc Lord: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/792858/warhammer-quest-lair-orc-lord",33969,onebitpixel
0,12875,Tensegrity Topper,"Summary Tensegrity Toppers for use in STEM/STEAM curriculum to help develop easy to assemble kits that demonstrate ways of building these types of structures; just connect to standard #2 pencils or wood dowels/carbon fiber rods for the struts as well as rubber bands, floss or wire as tension strands. These should print without the need for support. Most tensegrity examples require you to saw, cut or notch dowels which require sharp tools, repetitive cuts and may be unsafe in a class setting. Other methods require rubber caps, utilize tape+string and/or straws+paperclips that may not be as stable, efficient or scalable. There are other types of kits available but are either out-of-print and/or cost prohibitive to scale for a class setting. A challenge with tensegrity models is that they tend to collapse while being constructed, so patience is needed... It helps to have a system of jigging them to hold them in position while making the connections and cutting the tension strands to length. You can utilize the notch structure at the base of tensegritytopper08 to help hold connections in place temporarily. You can use knotted floss or smaller rubber bands to help hold struts together while you assemble it then remove/cut away the supports once assembled. tensegritytopper08_simple is a simplified nock setup to quickly put together standard structures without the need for additional complexity. tensegritytopperplug.stl is used to cover the ends; this can be used to hold the bands in place so they don't slip out during the build but it's optional. They can also be printed in different colors for visual variety. Depending on how much tension you want/require, you can use one longer band instead instead of multiple shorter bands; the photos included provide an example that shows two smaller rubber bands as tension strands and also includes some extra tension bands that are probably not needed. Some options to consider are playing with adding or removing tension bands at different points in the structure, connecting tension between middle points on a strut as well as testing the bounce/rigidity of the structure. The toppers can be printed in different colors and you can use a variety of different colors/length of rubberbands as well as using color pencils instead of standard #2 yellow pencils.

0,12876,Meeple Adventurer,"Summary ""Dr. Jones I presume?"" ; Meeple adventurer for outfitting your own board game. Two options; print drjones_single.stl w/support or print the snap-ons together on the build plate. The hat will have a tiny bit of infill support but it scrapes out quickly and can be fused to the meeple body with a little acetone. I prefer the Fedora a little tipped forward. You may have to clean out the hole to insert the handle of the whip; dip the whip handle end into a little acetone and insert it in the hand. Once it's set, you can flip the meeple over and dip the entire whip into acetone to soften it and reshape the curl as needed. This can be done with the Fedora to reshape it with the appropriate curls along the rim if want.",33969,onebitpixel

Print, w/o supports Assemble using snipped 1.75mm filament pins; glue or fuse as needed. A drop of superglue was used to glue the gemstone covers onto the top of the LED. The Cross will press fit nice and snug into the holy hand grenade topper piece but feel free to glue/fuse if you want. I used a simple wiring setup to house the battery and switch inside the hollow shape of the printed object. You hold it upright and it lights up; tilting it off-axis or laying it down on its side the LED light turns off. I've only pinned the bottom of my Holy Hand Grenade so I can replace the battery if needed. Two options for printing available; one with the full assembly and the other files w/items in separate printable files.",33969,onebitpixel
0,12880,Stone Archway Dungeon Door,Summary We needed some extra doors to extend our Warhammer Quest game; Print each column and archway separately; glue the pillars down to the appropriate base and then glue the archway on top. I print this using Sainsmart Silver ABS on an Afinia Printer at .15mm and use a dab of acetone to fuse them together. I've included a larger archway set that will fit the OpenForge 1x3 block - it's slightly larger and extends across the length better (file: simple_archway_openForge.stl) OpenForge Ruined Floor 1x3: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:530656 These print upright with some support; you can print the arches upside down if you need to save on ABS/support material. The large stone table/alter built from the arches is setup to print this way. I used Meshmixer to add the demon/goat head onto the top archway for a few of these; I did not include those files with this set since one of the licenses did not allow for remix/derivatives.

0,12883,Heart of the Carolina,"Summary Three different basic pendant designs based around the Heart of the Carolina; Simplified and ""detailed"" (w/Appalachian height map scaled); I had to make some simplification with the coastal region and outer banks. This prints out nicely in under 10 minute with a dimension about 1 1/4"" width. You can weave a chain through the back of the ""heart_of_nc_detail"" but this one may need to be printed with supports and the eyelets may need to be drilled and cleaned up a bit - I printed that model face down w/support. The others can have the chain or chain ring looped through the hole. I'm using these as a basis for casting but they look fine in ABS or PLA. I may send one through Shapeways and see how it turns out.",33969,onebitpixel
0,12884,Skull Tower,Summary Every dungeon needs a tower 'o skulls I was playing around with assembling something like this using a variety of different skulls on Thingiverse but the manifold/face collisions and polygon count would always seem to crash the different programs I used and were just too unwieldy; I finally found a good mix of skulls that work well together after some mild modifications. There are still some odd bits of geometry in here but for the most part they print in about 35minutes; they can probably be optimized a bit more; I am finding that different programs output a variety of different stl model sizes and no two work the same in terms of efficiency/optimizing. This is loosely based on an old Ral Partha tower of skull metal miniature I have and some books that I've been scanning through about The Catacombs of Paris; I created this for use in a Warhammer Quest terrain setting and a Library of Whispers scenario. Two models of different height and size are included. If I make up a round base/top I will update the files. Tallest scale height is 50mm w/around 30mm base; easily scaled as needed or use the smaller version which has a few more skulls Split file included; so you can print in two parts and 'weld' it back together w/o using supports updated; apparently I left some floating polygons during the split for the right side so it makes it difficult to lay it flat on the build plate; the new file is: skulltower-_square_02_right_fixed,33969,onebitpixel

Match two of these and insert with a color/cardboard printout of your favorite treasure chest texture - I recommend Kev's Lounge Paper Prints - Dungeon Furniture Pack. This model includes the pin hole for the weird little barrel bar that was included to hold the two sides together - but it isn't really needed, I've used toothpicks before as well, if you don't glue your inserts to the plastic. Prints flat on its back, no support in just under 15 minutes. Used a little acetone wash to soften the rivets, they are rounded in the original model. This was a good little project to teach kids about tolerances and using digital calipers - modify on Tinkercad as needed depending on thickness of card stock used. This thing was made with Tinkercad.

The statue is located across from Salisbury Street in front of the entrance to the Progress Energy Center for the Performing Arts. It's been a bit of public tradition to dress the statue up on different occasions throughout the year. http://q-artcode.org/sir-walter-raleigh-sculpture/ Sculptor and teacher Bruno Lucchesi, born in 1926, is renowned for his mastery of the human form. He was commissioned to create the Sir Walter Raleigh statue in 1975 in his home of Pietrasanta, Italy. The commission was seventy five years in the making, when a movement was formed in the early twentieth century to create a statue as a memorial to Sir Walter Raleigh, a 16th-centry English aristocrat known as a poet, writer, soldier and explorer and for whom North Carolina’s state capital was named. The statue was dedicated in 1976 as part of the national bicentennial celebration. It is made from bronze and is heroically scaled at 11 feet tall. Sir Walter Raleigh is on permanent loan to the City of Raleigh from the North Carolina Office of Archives and History.

Wood Pallet; textured Wood Pallet; simple 50mm x 50mm Used a svg wood pattern to etch wood planks; This prints in about 20-45 minute depending on how detailed you want your pallet wood grooves to show up - @ 0.15mm layer height you can see the detail of the nail heads. Overkill, but it turns out to be a nice subtle textured effect. printed in abs; used acetone to 'glue' the planks together. be sure to remember to glue the smooth side down so your texture is on the outer faces; if you want that detail to show up... you could probably print them vertically/upright but it will possibly need a little support between each plank;",33969,onebitpixel

0,12894,Thunder Lightning,"Summary I'm in the middle of rebuilding the oop ""Bommerz over da Sulpher River"" and needed some models for the Imperial Thunderbolt and Ork Fighta-bommer; I finished the Imperial Jet this evening and after going through a few other changes I'll be ready to test print this weekend; This is loosely mashed up from reference pictures from DakkaDakka, Boardgamegeek and bits from Thingiverse and SketchUp 3D Warehouse. The original game used models from the 40k Epic line of smaller 6mm minis; I'll probably not be printing these any larger then 40mm or 60mm. I have to go back through my reference folder for the other bits I pulled from sources on Thingiverse and attribute them later this weekend. I've run this through netfabb once; however I think there is still some clean up to do - I admittedly got a little lazy while just building it out and blocking it in so I'm sure there are more cleanups in the model that need to be done; one can go a little overboard adding little bits and greebles... 7/14 - printed successfully on Rep2x; @ 75%; final size 3""x3""x1""; 84minutes; wings are a little thin at this scale so I may go back in and make a new model with thicker wings at the proper size.",33969,onebitpixel
0,12895,Monster Acrylic Dice Tube - Conversion,"Summary Convert new or broken Monster Acrylic tubes into Dice Holders and/or Dice Tower; We have several of these tubes from Monster - used to hold playmats; a few seem to chip or crack on the closed ends after being dropped or shoved precariously into a bookbag... instead of throwing them out, we converted a few to hold dice and use them as dice tubes/towers using these inserts. Depending on wear/tear you will need to saw off the closed end or use a hole saw drill bit to cut out a feeder hole to drop your dice in; or fall out depending on your preference. I'll probably rework this for standard circular acrylic tubes (2"" diameter) note: I've had to modify the percentage scale a little depending on whether I printed them using an Afinia or a Rep2x; ymmv I printed the two (alternating) single units at 0.30mm height taking about ~90 minutes to print... no support needed; printed 6 and slid them gently into the tube; no glue needed, friction held. I have not printed the alternating units with the mana symbols within them yet; that's lined up for this weekend. The tube rings are used to slide over the acrylic tube as 'grips'; careful not to snap them when sliding over the outside.

0,12901,Dutchman Shelf,"Summary Made a smaller version for kitchen iPad holder; I would have preferred it in cherry or walnut, but this is the next best option until I get some new router bits. Current shelf strip has two countersink screw holes applied; this may need to be modified to accommodate different screw head sizes. You don't have to have the screws mounted flush to the shelf board, however, if you want to be able to slide the pins freely w/o catching on the screws then you will have to countersink whatever screws you use to hold this to the wall; I have not tested this for use with heavier load/weights so take that into consideration if you want to try to use this for something heavier; wood pins tend to hold well and usually don't split depending on the cut and grain; not sure about the filament layers and interior shell patterns for this particular model. Dutchman/butterfly joints were used for centuries in utilitarian woodworking and as pins to connect/hold two separate pieces of planks/beams. This version now brought to new life as a minimalist utilitarian hanger/charger/organizer is based on Peter Duncan's Kickstarter that unfortunately was not successful; https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thewoodstudio/the-dutchman As seen on Yanko: http://www.yankodesign.com/2014/01/31/all-in-one-wall-accessory/ Instructions Rep 2x; ~2hours @ .30 / 15% infill;",33969,onebitpixel

0,12907,Cathedral Game,"Summary These are the various parts of a custom board game pieces based on the wooden Cathedral game. Very basic simple shapes there are many ways you could customize this and add details to (shingles, stonework, gargoyles, windows, ripples in the fountains et.al.) or you could pull other models in for substitute pieces as long as they fit in the spaces, you can prime and paint anyway you want... Printed on an Afinia, 3 layer density, big hole; running ~2.5 hours to 4.5 hours per file depending on print settings. Print time will vary depending on scale and print settings. Be careful printing on perf board as you may tear out the bottom if you don't print enough infill or if you are in a hurry. I aligned objects to fit on an Afinia/Up platform size as well as keeping the print directions and object heights as uniform as possible to make things print a little more efficiently (I guess it's all depending on how you rotate them and how your software slices it up). You may need to slightly modify the two ""C"" (Castle) shaped buildings, the tolerances are pretty close and depending on ABS expansion your pieces may fit too 'snug'. Print 4x of the game border file to enclose the whole city if you like. I have a Cathedral World set that's showing some signs of wear and tear with two pieces lost that I ended up printing 3d models as substitutes... We also travel set that we had scratch built in wood; I created these so we could print it on the 3D printer using different color ABS as needed or scale them to what ever size one wanted. The church is modified with a hollow cross cut through all four sides of the tower; it can be challenging to clear out the support material but it is possible; If you prefer you can always grab the other cathedral game piece here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:107522 You can tinker with the some of the base models here: https://tinkercad.com/things/iwYoCVteJrZ https://tinkercad.com/things/eabMC2YWzE8 More info about the game and the many other variations on BoardGameGeek: http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/7/cathedral",33969,onebitpixel

0,12966,Robo 3D R1 Double 40 mm fan setup - hexagon hot end,"I found that the other double mounts didn't fit my machine because it seems that the hexagon hot end was raised 1-2 mm in my particular Robo 3D R1 model (purchased August 2015). 
The other designs were scrapping the build platform. Specifically I tried this ones: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:821080 http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1026691 I kept the same double mount and modelled the shrouds again.
However several modifications were made to accommodate the extra mm that were needed to clear the build platform and still point the air nozzles in the right direction. The inner surfaces were given a nice curved contour so air flows smoothly to the nozzle end. It sits nicely 3 mm above the build platform now! 
I used 2 coarse threaded 1/8"" phillips screws to mount each fan shroud onto the double mount and 2 fine threaded 1/8"" allen screws to secure each fan to its respective shroud. The shroud holes where the fan gets screwed should be threaded using the appropriate 1/8"" tap, be gentle when threading this holes because if you try to do it in just one go you will heat up the plastic and destroy the threads, just do 1-2 mm at a time and pull out the tap rolling backwards, do this until you get the hole threaded all the way to the other side.

Once you have printed the 4 parts needed for the mold and one or more rims, yo need to remove the clogs if present in the pattern for the rubber, will come off with hands and/or with the help of a cutter, now see if the pieces fit togheter, if not, mybe you have to sand it a bit; when you have a good result veryfy with a meter the internal diameter for make sure it is a circle and not elliptic. All close togheter? Good you are ready to the next step How to mold the rubber: now you need some materials: 1)acetic silicone (the color you like) 2) cornstarch or other starch 3) colorant in powder (optional if your silicone is transparent or white) 4) carbon powder or toner (also optional if you need more friction resistence, be careful if you use toner) 5) an old container for make the misture Procedure: first put in the conteiner a bit of cornstarch, then add a (must to define for one wheel) quantity of silicone, now start to add the rest of starch slowly while amalgamate all whith a baton, continue untill the compost is handled. Then disassemble ur mold and take the rim, mold with hands the silicone compost, can use gloves for safety, and start to put on the rim, about 1cm excess the diameter of the rim, put a bit of starch on the mold parts for avoid attacks. Now support the patterns for the rabber up the compost you have depositated on the rim and press a little bit for make them fit, now install the downside of the mold and fit with little streight, then install the upside of the mold and press all with streight. The excess of material will come out the holes in the upside, now wait about 1 our before disassemble. If all is gone successfully you have make the first wheel! Repeat all with the others.

However, this is just a mechanical spool bushing, mounted on any threaded rods of your choice, Just adjust the parameters and some other stuffs in the scad files to fit your liking and print away. You can use any kind of filament stand with this, save more filament and not to mention, it is quite stylish and cool as well to have something simple, and mechanical properties as well. The picture is an example of how it is assembled and mounted on your existing filament holder. Please give me feedback. Instructions What's needed: At least 3-4 M3 x 16mm screw (for outer part) At least 6-8 M3 x 12mm screw (for center part) Threaded rod of your choice 2 nuts for the threaded rod of your choice Print at least: 3 arms 2 center (of your choice) 3 holder (of your choice) Put them all together like in picture shown, then the nut of each side of the threaded rod will be used to compress the mechanical spool bushing One example of filament holder you can pair with this is http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:712159 but you just replace the spool bushing with mine SCAD files: Do change the parameters and values to your liking and experiment with it, I'm still new in openscad so you have to adjust one by one.

0,13076,Geeetech Carriage Compatible Groove Mount v2 with Servo Mount,"Summary Version 2 of the Geeetech Carriage Compatible Groove Mount, This one has 2 different extruder mount, top and bottom Use the top one to lower the nozzle even more which is the nuts and screws are mounted on top just like the previous version, v1 Use the bottom one if you want to reduce the nozzle from sticking out The idea here again, to make it compatible just like the previous version, but also, what's new in this is I emphasize on maximizing z axis height and to minimize the need to extend or calibrating too much when you are changing between the stock and e3d type nozzle that are longer compared to the stock geeetech nozzle. More screws needed especially mounting the extruder on the mount, you gonna need extra 4xm4 scrwes/bolts mounted from the bottom, also if you could can make some 'fanduct' that's compatible with this NOTE: The mount holes are for geeetech x-carriage, it is not compatible with vanilla or other variant screw holes and you can refer here for x-carriage compatible to this extruder mount http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:886515 Also I need your feedback, image and suggestion that I might able to improve or adjust this extruder mount I've fitted my e3d v6 here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqfmADIjP2k&list=PLb7sKitt_N_CRhatUqbEtEncIshFv4Ro6&index=2 UPDATE 26TH JUNE 2015 Added Servo mount, fastener base and fastener servo to enable you guys to use auto bed leveling system, the dimension are based on sky tower pro servo which has this dimension Body: 23 x 13 x 8(from the mount till cable outlet) Mount: 33mm wide Update 28th June 2015 made small adjustment to servo mount so it really does fit snuggly this time Update 5/8/2015: Inductive sensor add-on here http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:956051 Instructions This can be used as bowden or direct dirve. For direct drive you need to print the extruder.stl, to mount your mk8 extruder onto this extruder mount and you gonna need another 4 m4 screws. This is to ensure the extruder stays in place Don't forget to rotate the parts before printing to achieve best structure integrity with less or no support needed The bottom mount might uses more plastic, this is to ensure the mount are rigid and able to support the motor's weight",27419,Mohd.Asraff Amzani
0,13077,Wire Clamp on Stepper Motor,"Summary I'm not sure what name should I give, stepper motor bracket, stepper motor wire clamp or something. By the way, this design is actually for my hot end cable and to fix it in place because there might be a chance that the hot end might become loose due to slight stress from the wire moving back and forth. The clamp size are measured around 5mm, which clamps the teflon wire cover. Also suitable mainly for Geeetech single extruder style and for other purposes of mounting this on any stepper motor for some cable management. For mine, I added extra platform so I could stick my led array there but it kept falling off (using foam double sided tape) Update I added several design to the cap, one has flat end until the clamp, one is flat same thickness as the flat surface of 2mm, another is 3 point open end so you can mount it anyway you like it Instructions Can be printed with 10% infill, 3 wall and 4 tops/bottom. This is to ensure the other end still offers flexibility especially mine with pla plastic For geeetech owner, do make sure to limit your max X axis movement because this bracket can hit the z axis threaded rod. Mine limited up to 185mm without any offsets from endstops You might be having trouble putting on m3x24 nut at lower back, I suggest you mount it from the back and use pliers to hold the nut while turning the screw",27419,Mohd.Asraff Amzani

0,13079,Geeetech Z-Axis Cable Bracket,Summary Just a simple cable bracket that will be fitted on top of the z-axis top bracket since the screws has 2mm extra length and to hold down the extruder cable that has been rerouted from the top of the frame right down through the left side of z axis. This is to avoid the cable from falling out of place in the future and surprisingly the cable bracket are somewhat flexible until you can just loop it together until 2 of those screw holes met and mount on one screw only This bracket should fit on any 3d printer or somewhere usable,27419,Mohd.Asraff Amzani
0,13080,Geeetech Z-Axis Top Bracket,"Summary Someone pointed that I should cut my threaded rod below the stock acrylic parts hole but I don't want to cut it instead I took the trouble to model a bracket that doesn't hold the threaded rod. This is often for those who are having wobble issues where the threaded rod already bent (like mine here https://youtu.be/kOVKfpDfA9U) and needs to be replaced. It does fixed my problem but only for lower layers by around 3cm of print layers only before the wobble starts to occur again. At least it somehow fixed the problem temporarily Instructions There are 2 files included, if you have a bad wobble issues, print with the 1mm wobble file first because it does fit on my first print. However the smooth rood bracket for the 1mm wobble thing are not aligned with the original bracket. Use it for temporary fix to your wobble problem then print the other one. Printed with about 20% infill, 4 bottom/top and 3 layer of walls",27419,Mohd.Asraff Amzani
0,13081,8mm Rod Clamp,"Summary This was based on the original prusa parts to mount the endstop on the smooth rods. I recreated the design based on that and removed the platform to mount the endstop. The idea here is to replace the black steel ring in the picture because the steel ring can't fit on the other 3 of my rods due to slight size differences. This rod clamp replaces that and also for those people having the same x-axis design as mine (refer to the picture). One of the smooth rod slid out a little bit when I tried to print something with 50mm/s because there are no rod clamp to stop the smooth rod from being slid out due to the fast carriage movement This uses m3 bolt and nuts Instructions Print this with full infill to give best rigidity I printed mine using someone's printer, zortrax z-abs and should be okay for you guys using conventional abs too",27419,Mohd.Asraff Amzani
0,13082,Belt idler guide,"Summary This is a belt idler guide for 13mm bearring that will fit on most 3d printer. I found out that the belt tends to grind on the edge of the tensioner/idler and this is not a good idea to leave it grinding at the edge. It might break the belt one day and the benefits of adding this little friend you will get smoother and lighter motion while lessening the friction caused by the grinding at the edge The plastic were grinded on the edge of the bearing holder, it might generate a lot of plastic particles Instructions Printed mine with these parameters ABS layer 0.1 bed 110c extruder 230 speed 20mm",27419,Mohd.Asraff Amzani
0,13083,Honeycomb Stacks,"A honeycomb styled stacking compartment, stylish and it is fully modular.
Expand them by printing even more and you can use it for any small stuffs with the original size.
Honeycomb design are well known for their shapes that fully utilizes the spaces.
Not only that, they can also be used for wall decoration, or wall mounted honeycomb style shelves (drill the center), and screw them to your wall (scale to your liking).
There are 2 files, print 4-5 ""hex MF.stl"" and one ""hex F.stl"", this is to ensure that you can fill in all the honeycomb slots with the stacks
Tested on Up3d, Zortrax and Reprap (my 3d printer), all of them are able to fit snuggly. for larger prints, just upscale them and retain all the scales if you want to pair them up
NOTE:
For reprap based owners, this is intended for a printer that has been well fine tuned, if the female slot seems slightly smaller than the male and unable to fit due to size, try to calibrate your filament flow rate. The joints are meant to fit perfectly and seems hard to slot the male to female at first, let the joints has friction so that they are able to hold their own weights",27419,Mohd.Asraff Amzani

0,13113,Reversible Hinge,"This is an idea I had for printed-assembled, reversible hinges.
I started with HingeBox Printable As An Assembled Unit Without Supports by profhankd. I cut off the hinge section from the source STL file and remodeled it in SketchUp using his design as a guide. My hinges are actually double hinges or can be thought of as links between two rotating plates. 
In my first test, the links were very thin. The resulting hinge was floppy and the two sections are able to twist, because there is nothing keeping the links parallel.
In the second test, I removed a link and made them about the same length as the solid sections of the plates. This hinge was much more stable and the twisting was almost gone.
In the third and final test, I made the links as long as possible, and the solid sections of the plates very thin. In order to do this, I had to flip the conical pins and hollows within the hinges. This hinge was the most stable of the three and to me it is the most aesthetically pleasing.
Let me know if you end up using these in any of your projects!

0,13118,LG G Watch Charging Stand,"Charging a watch flat on a table has no added utility.
I recently purchased this Black Stainless Steel Watch Band for my LG G Watch. It looks great, but makes it impossible to use the charging cradle flat as it was designed, as the watch band doesn't open completely. Instead you have to put the cradle inside the band to charge the watch. This isn't terrible, but it's not great either. Plus, charging a watch flat on a table has no added utility.
I set out to design a stand that holds the charging cradle so the watch could be placed on it from one side. If the cradle was tilted at enough of an angle it would also allow you to use your watch as a clock. The G Watch is perfect for this as the screen is always on.
So there I was, naively thinking I was the first person to have this idea. Turns out I wasn't, but that's okay. This is probably a common occurrence for people when they first get into 3D printing. I soldiered on and created something that meets my needs perfectly. Now it sits on my nightstand. It's very stable and it's working great as a clock.
The stand is set up for use with the original USB cable. It would likely need to be modified if using a different cable. A friction fit cable management channel has curved corners to avoid bending the cable too sharply. I then went a little nuts and chamfered all the edges in the model, but I think it looks pretty nice when printed. There were a few flaws in my print, but I blame those on improper printer calibration rather than my modeling.

if you don't have a 3D printer you can purchase this at https://www.shapeways.com/product/GU9LCJ7JY/runaway-blimp-aka-raytheon-jlens
So everyone a nice piece of military technology at their desk.. a nice fighter jet or a nice tank.. You can buy these already painted and assembled or you can buy nice kits that allows you to do such things. However, i have something even better and is 3D printed!!
You know a fighter jet is a couple of million of dollars.. so are tanks.. but if you are a baller you want something that costed billions.. (but not as expensive as the F-35 which is at Trillions of dollars and doesn't even work yet). i have the perfect piece of military memorabilia
Anyways i'm kind of famous for making butt plugs as you can see in my website politicalsculptor.com or you can just google ""Fernando Sosa 3D"".. i didn't choose to be the butt plug man but it just happened.. So when i saw this butt plug looking thing on TV for a couple of hours, i was intrigued.. However, When i found this monstrosity, butt plug looking thing costed the american tax payer almost 4 BILLION DOLLARS.. I went from intrigued to pissed off...
So according to some research i did this is part of a pair of butt plug balloons, i mean Blimps.. These blimps are flown extremely high and connected with a huge cable to tiny land bases.. I'm guessing the wireless model cost more than 2 billion dollars.. These things suppose to be able to detect missiles and aircrafts that fly very low that aren't detectable by regular radar. Which i think is bull shit because apparently the other ""working"" blimp wasn't able to detect the run away blimp that had gotten away.
Anyways this extremely expensive ballon somehow got lose and apparently has no way of being controlled since it doesn't appear to have any propellers and the 2 billion dollar remote control that deflates it wasn't working. )i'm guessing the one with propelers and working remote is 3 billion dollars.
So whenever you are working your ass off at your office and wonder where in the fuck your tax dollars are going.. Now you can stare at this butt plug looking thing and be assured that your money is making someone at some government contractor like Raytheon or Lockheed Martin very very rich and we are getting some non working piece of military technology that took out the power of about 30,000 people because we did't buy the wireless model..
Disclaimer: This is satire and if Raytheon doesn't wan't to see this kind of embarrassing product being made maybe you should not be over charging us the tax payer with shitty products that don't work and run away!!!

I have designed the filament holder mount that supersedes most of the holders which is now capable of handling up to 1kg weight resting direct on top of the Mini 3D Fabrikator TinyBoy Machine. This has been thoroughly tested with much thought in minimizing completely all complex modules, eliminating all screws or bearings required, absolutely detachable & re-mountable for transport, hidden reinforcement design including ergonomic sexy curve for appealing structure. 
In addition, the fact of reducing the amount of filament required for the full solid strong piece is definitely worth acquiring. You can put Olive Oil at top for Reel Rolling Lubrication. 
(1st Nov 2015 Addon: An added amendment enhancement to induce a very simple light weight bracket blocker for 0.5kg Reels onto the initial design. This prevents the normal small reels from turning over the depth of 1kg reels)

The thickness of the entire model is now 2mm. Previous version was not even on some spots, so a bit of filament savings. The eyes are no longer squinting which helps with visibility and the eyelashes sweeping on the edges. The mouth is now open with a slight grin and you can breath easy or stick your tongue out. :}~

As you can see from the last few pictures, it's gone through some revisions, with this being the final form. The camera stand features a the hidden wire tunnel along the back. No wire hanging about loosely. The ball joint connector is very stiff, which makes it easy to point the camera in any direction.
Lastly, the stand itself is pretty hefty, reducing any vibration and wobble from being recorded by the camera itself. If you want the stand for the right side, just mirror the stand in your slicing app. 
Print Settings

0,13324,Fan shroud for Printrbot Simple metal using E3Dv6 hotend,"Modified the Simonwlchan excellent shroud http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:958450  to fit with a shorter spacer for a e3dv6 hotend. Also removed some extra design elements to print a bit faster. Added a picture of the bridge-torture-test_50mm after installing this fan. Probably should lower the temperature a touch more, but it came out pretty damn great. 
With the latest changes, I shortened the length of the shroud's nozzle so it no longer hits the bed. I also widened the mouth and pointed it down. The air flow hits right below the hot end's nozzle with a wider pattern. 
You can see the new picture of the bridge-torture-test_50mm and it's improved an improvement. Again, thanks to Simonwlchan for making the original shroud this remix is based off.

0,13340,Blue Dog V3 : Unibody Quadcopter,"Summary I designed this Quadcopter with the intention of making it quicker to assemble than other DIY kits. Here are the features: ARMS 4 Arms and Main plate form a single structure. No need to bolt the arms and main plate together. Arms desgined for 3100KV Motor with 5 MM shaft and M2 screws Arms have 2 pairs of slots for routing a cable tie. 40 MM max width of arm to accomodate upto 6A ESCs Arm thickness is 2 MM supported by a 5 MM wide and 10 MM thick under skirt. Skirt adds rigidity to the arms while also acting as a landing gear with wide load distribution. Main Plate 60 MM wide and 200 MM long main plate for placing Micro FPV camera, VTX, FC, RX and a 2S battery in the same plane 18 M3 holes evenly spread across the body for mounting accessories. Outer holes form a 30.5 square for mounting a CC3D board. Horizontal slits for rounting wires and velcros. Supported by 5MM wide and 10 MM thick under skirt. Adds rigidity to the 2 MM thick plate while also acting as a landing skid. Accessories: 10 Degree tilted FPV Camera Mount Tail for adding an Rx or its antenna Note that this is intended to be a not-fast quadcopter: aimed at FPV beginners. My goal is to create something like a Blade 180 QX with the power of brushless motors. I will be assembling this on my own when the print is ready. Instructions Added 3100KV Motors with 2 MM Bullet connectors. Will be using 6A ESCs on this. The Arms/Wings are warped a bit. More so on the left side. Hope it doesn't affect the flight too much.",36433,shubham.mankhand
0,13341,Drag Chain,"Summary
This drag chain is actually parametric and can be customised via the source or the customiser available on Thingiverse.  Two popular sizes are available here. 
The chain is designed to be printed assembled. You can choose to print any number of links, and whether to include the chain mounts. The performance of this chain compares admirably to that of commercial chains. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQgd3H_QV24
Instructions
Practical limits apply depending on your printer abilities, the design is best printed assembled. Choose as many links as your printbed can fit, remember you can rotate at 45 deg to fit more.
Once printed the chain will be slightly fused depending on your printer quality, you need to work the chain loose. If the chain is fused to solidly and breaks try increase the ""Anti Stick"" parameter, be sure to take a bit of time to work the links so they are nice and loose, squeezing the pins while doing this helps.
A shell thickness of 1.5 -> 2mm usually gives the best results, the minimum chain size is mostly limited by your printer calibration and quality. Some of these instructions assume you are using the source to customise the chain.",26957,TuxSoft

You can cut through your chassis and fix the supercharger with a support from below, (that is that I did) or simply just fix on the top of the bonnet of your RC with some kind of glue/tape/screw. . .etc. (double side tape is quite practical. I use this to prevent the damage of the chassis during fall over)

0,13354,Flashforge/Replicator Z-Axis Gantry Ribcage,"Summary I dislike the flat wood backplates that our machines have, and feel like 3DP parts could be stiffer, and more visually pleasing. I also wanted to try out optimization with Altair Inspire, as I have a demo of it currently. I modeled over optimization, then finished engineered details. And thus, this ""ribcage"" for the Z-axis of our machines. You'll have to trim the underside blocks to fit the holes in your plywood, as I modeled them oversize. You'll see in my installation that I broke an arm - it's not a perfect thing but it's GREATLY improved over stock. The Z axis is rock-solid now. Works best with RC-Lohas stainless stiffeners and the spacer blocks for them here on Thingiverse (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:770902) Designed for a 5mm thick plate of glass, but you can move the mech-stop-block down by chopping away at it. It might be within spring-space of being able to take a stock build plate. YMMV. Print Settings Rafts: NoSupports: Yes Notes: Either print as-is or on its ""back."" You'll need supports under the whole of the structure if printed upright. Scale by 10! I farked, and it's scaled wrong :P",36523,rdahm
0,13355,Flashforge/CTC Control Enclosure,"Summary I've been tired of the stock front panel for a while. But, I also don't want to have the controls fixed to the front of the machine. What if I want to move the display in front of my webcam? What if I don't want to get up to start a print, or change settings? For these problems, and more, I developed a nice little enclosure for the LCD, buttons, and SD card reader on our printers. Prints wonderfully, sometimes both do without supports! Back is definitely support/raft free. Front should be raft free, support is YMMV but my machine does the SD card slot bridge with no support/no issue. Still working on a proper snap connection. Print Settings Rafts: NoSupports: Doesn't Matter Post-Printing Screw some M3 bolts into the bosses provided, holding the stock components in. You have a lot of wiggle room with screw length. I'm using spacers to keep the bolt heads off the board, but do whatever suits your fancy.",36523,rdahm
0,13356,Yamaha XJ600 In-Frame Ignition Mount,"Summary My 1994 Yamaha XJ600 has had a naked conversion done and the ignition switch was moved down into the frame where the infills (would/should/will) be. This is made so that the switch is zip-tied into the mount, then onto the frame. I'd like to revise it so that it cradles into the frame better, but this is fine for now. Better than zip ties. Print Settings Rafts: NoSupports: YesResolution: 0.20Infill: 65% Notes: Supports under the front overhang only, everything else should be fine. 65% infill on my machine is nearing no-air-gap on the infill with ABS, so I like the weight/performance ratio.

0,13357,Shoei RF-1200 GoPro Chin Mount,"Summary This is a mount meant for GoPro-style clips on the chin of a Shoei RF-1200. Uses VHB pads meant for GoPro mounts, available all over the web. MIGHT fit the RF-1100. Has a cut-out to accommodate opening the chin vent. This currently is a prototype (V6) and after riding with it I'll make some changes if they're necessary. I can make variations on this if needed. EDIT: Uploaded a V6, which should take up more of the room between the vent and the bottom of the chin, and hopefully lines up with a VHB pad slightly better. V6 has no vent-slider-notch as it seemed kind-of useless. Instructions 3D scan with Skanect, reconstructed in Rhino, model built in Rhino, printed in S3D @ 50% infill, ABS, 110 plate 230 extruder. See gallery for where I printed supports - I also used a sticky disk (an 0.5mm thick disk under an object) because the sides are mostly flat.",36523,rdahm

It's a little thick (read: overengineered) compared to the original, but I'm not going to complain about thick, angular things in a Volvo ;) Instructions Printed this particular one at 80% infill (honeycomb, but rectilinear would be fine) at 0.15 layer in ABS. You'll need some support for the rear clips. Also, you can print it on its side for increased strength, but will need taller supports, still around the clips.",36523,rdahm

0,13360,"Makeup ""Pot"" with Lid","Summary Girlfriend wanted something to use for traveling with smaller amounts of cosmetics. This is modeled after some of what she has laying around. Parts are threaded and have tolerances to fit (IIRC it was 0.50mm part to part and 0.25mm thread to thread, since the thread and body were toleranced at different points during modeling). Every print I've made requires a few turns in and out to ""break in"" the threads before use but once they work they work well. Instructions I kept the infill relatively low (15%) and used standard (2) shells, but I did print them with 0.15mm and 0.13mm layer heights to keep the inside surface as smooth as possible.",36523,rdahm
0,13361,"Seated Split Washer for Caphead M3 Bolts (FlashForge Creator, Re","Summary Wanted to stop the cap-head screws on my new FlashForge from sinking themselves into the frame as time goes on. It's a holiday, and the hardware store was closed - but why would I not print these anyway? Washers are split to allow for insertion without full disassembly. There's a recess for the cap head to sit in so that they stay seated and don't slip out while assembling. They're not the prettiest but they print quick and tighten down nice. Let me know if you'd like to see changes or alterations! Update: Added a ""thick"" version. This has an under-head seat of 1mm instead of 0.5mm for the standard version. I printed a few of these to use on certain screws along the frame but this thickness sometimes requires full bolt removal. For this reason it's not a V2 - they both have their uses.",36523,rdahm

0,13397,Y-Axis Bracket for Mini 3D Fabrikator Tiny Boy Final,"I had seriously reviewed a few of the designs for the Y-Axis Stepper Motor Fan Mount portion and concluded the best position for the most limited space constrained part on the Mini Fabrikator TinyBoy. Never design something that will block or hit the movement of the print while it is moving or that you're zeroing at full bed length tests! It is very obvious on larger size prints near 80mm.
Heat without bracket has reached 56 to 60deg Celsius for stock printer. If your stepper reached 80deg Celsius , it would mean your POTs on Ramps Board for all steppers are not normally set to 0.60-0.62V and 1.12 at the other measured legs. Below these volts and you'll notice the extrude pauses for half a sec at certain prints resulting in multiple stains. The bracket is capable of reducing between 7 to 10deg Celsius differences as tested.
Prior to the big 12cm strong fan bringing down X & Z Axis to near 34deg Celsius, putting the tiny bracket for my 30mm fan has successfully maintained the temperature to around 49deg Celsius during operation. The printer has been printing non-stop 24hours for weeks to near months without problems.
I had chosen ABS Black material base (Black absorbs heat in my view) on the heat produced from the Y-Stepper but you can opt for PLA in your preferences. ABS does warp without hotbed but in my case, since it is tiny and small, I regard it negligible and acceptable as a functional excellent solution. For any equipment, as long as the operating temperature is maintained at minimal, it will be prolonged for it's lifespan.

0,13401,DW660 Dust Shoe,"This dust shoe allows vertical attachment of a 2.5"" diameter tube for low resistance suction. It should be printed with support both inside and out at least 30% infill.
I used the 'grid' support option in Cura at 0.2mm, this made the support quite easy to detach.
After printing insert 3x magnets into the shoe part, and 3x magnets into the skirt. Ensure you get polarity correct! You can then insert the magnet hole shims to cover the magnets. You can optionally glue these shims into place though I found this unnecessary as they are a tight fit.
To assemble the skirt, you can print either the outer skirt spring or the ordinary spring depending on the diameter skirt you prefer. I use the outer spring. Simply cut foam to fit around the diameter (inner or outer) then hold it in place with the spring part. See photos for details. You can optionally use a large cable tie around the outer spring for extra security.",36620,Ben Delarre

I used PLA, printed at .3mm layer height using my Robo3D. No support material needed. I included two options here, after I completed the first one, I noticed there was more bend in the spine that I'd like so I created a sturdier one (the one labeled ""sturdy""). So if you're decided which to print, go with that one. It's just got a thicker spine so it won't risk snapping as easily.
The only thing you'll need to do is add two springs to the back. They attach to little tabs I've added. I use some 11/32"" x 1-7/16"" Extension Springs (see picture) I found at a local hardware store. But some different sizes of springs could successfully be used and may fit your needs better.

It's all 3D printed, the only extra parts are the 2 ball bearings and a piece of 2.5mm carbon fiber (or steel) to strengthen the (fully printed) toothed belt pulley. It's the absolute minimum size needed to do the job properly, and my Print Head carriage doesn't crash into the Y-idler bearing assembly anymore, plus it's really quiet and should never wear out.

The weight that prevents the spilling over can be anything - I used a scrap piece of Nylon (approx 10mm x 20mm x 300mm), but anything that's slightly slippery could be used. shapes.scad is available at http://svn.clifford.at/openscad/trunk/libraries/shapes.scad This design relies on the Solidoodle Spool Holder Mk2 by gsterley ( http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:97734 ), but can be easily modified (in openSCAD) for many similar spool holders I initially thought of extremely complicated kludges with springs and elastic, but settled on gravity as being much simpler - and it hardly ever fails :-)",36785,ftlpilot

This chain is threaded onto filament, wire or elastic cord instead of linking together with little nubs like most chains (which kinda sucks in my opinion). Still needs some work on the ends but that's specific to my printer design. The chain itself is good to go. Modify the ends to suit your needs. I suppose filaflex would be good for stringing it together but regular PLA seems to work. Insulated 16 AWG copper wire works great too. The Sketchup files are included so you can modify it as needed. There is almost no limit to how long you can make this since it won't pop apart. The tolerance is very forgiving too since you can clean up the spine holes with a drill. If your printer can spit out plastic you can make this. Instructions Thread your wire or plastic thru the holes looping it back thru the top bit around the mounting bolt hole. A knot at either lose end and/or a dab of glue in the spine tube keeps it attached to the base plate part. I'm going to use some nice flexible multi strand wire for my chain spine.

Please take the time to Like this for the contest. Here is a video of it https://youtu.be/Q1OcJvvggyc Instructions All parts print flat without support. Stack the blade parts on threaded rod and tighten them together. They align themselves and lock into position. 608 skate bearings are used on either side of the gear plates to ensure smooth movement. The rock tumbling grit will simply be various grits of sandpaper cut into small pieces and a cup of water. Start with a coarse 100 grit and finish with a very fine 1000 grit. There is no need to buy the very expensive commercial grits available for rock tumblers. The paper gets pounded into nothing by the rocks and the grit ends up in solution to polish the rocks.

0,13492,RobotDigg Spool holder with 608ZZ skate bearing inserts,"Summary I could not find anything on Thingiverse that fit my RobotDigg PLA spools so I made this 4 mm thick spool holder, quick print.

Fits 21.93 mm diameter skate bearings, nice friction fit with a taper at the back to keep the bearing from being pushed into the spool. The Robot Digg spools Have a 38.14 mm diameter hole. 104 mm from center to base so fits the 200 mm diameter Robot Digg spool. The cross members are a tight fit so tapping them on with a small hammer and a drop of crazy glue makes a nice strong connection.

So I mucked around this last weekend, set it printing late at night and it came out perfectly first time. I love it! :-) Clearances around the 1,75mm filament along the compression path are purposefully minimised to allow for printing Ninjaflex etc. Be sure to insert a stiff spring between the base nipple and the swing arm nipple to force the roller and filament against the pinch roller.This uses a 10mm diameter pinch roller, don't tighten the grub screw until you have some filament fed through the cavities to hold the pinch roller in place. Note that the swing arm has some bridge support built in which will have to be removed before the bearing is inserted. Also wind down your motor current a bit before fitting the linked stepper motor.

Double Hotend fix for Prusa Dual hotend support for Printer Prusa I3 with bowden. 
New version, lock with rounded corners.
Made for object: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:990595
Made in OpenSCAD, you can change all. 
Instructions:
Maybe you need adjust the OpenSCAD file for your hotend and create a new STL file. 
I see lots of different hotend sizes but it will fit in:
Hotend - 16mm diameter x 5mm height base and 12mm neck. 
Hotend - 16mm diameter x 5mm height base and 10mm neck.
You can just cut out 5mm in the hotend base or use bigger screws if you have space in case:
Hotend - 16mm diameter x 10mm height base and 12mm neck. 
Hotend - 16mm diameter x 10mm height base and 10mm neck.
Attention: 
The distance between the centers of the hotends is 30mm. 
My hotends have 22mm in the head + cables and screws. 
I believe you will not have problems until 25mm in the head. That is all.
You can download this design for free at thingiverse: http://www.thingiverse.com/jsirgado/designs
But you can help me to make more things like this, buy it.

Even there are already a few on Thingiverse, none of them are very good for the kind of hats that I like to make, so I thought I would share this ingenious little design with you guys. I changed a couple things from the original to make it printable without supports. Print the loom and then the hook and needle. Knitting instructions: Take some wool and tie a loose knot around the base. Then, moving in an anticlockwise direction from one peg to the other, wrap the wool around the next peg in a clockwise loop. Do this to the next one and the next until you have a single row of loops. Push the loops down a little and then make a second row above the first. Then, using the hook, pull the first/lower loop on each peg, over the second/higher loop and over the head of the peg. Then let it drop and move onto the next peg. Once you only have only one row of loops on all the pegs, put down the hook/hold it between your teeth/stick it behind your ear and use your hand to make another wool row. Repeat until you have a long enough tube. Remember, you probably want to fold back the first few rows once you put it on your head to form a cute little fold, so make sure to account for that (10 extra rows is usually sufficient). Once you are sure you have the desired length, cut about 1m of the wool, thread it through the needle and go through the last row of loops ""doubled-up"", simply allowing the loop to slide up over the needle, onto the tread and off the peg. Tighten. Sow on a pom pom and voila!",19484,Pirateprincess

0,13571,Iron Works Sculpture,"Summary Iron Works Relief Wall Panel; NC State University, College of Design; Raleigh, NC 4' x 6'; 3"" deep Agisoft Photoscan, 87 photos This particular panel has a fracture at the top left; since it's mounted vertically on a wall casting could be difficult without removing the entire thing and moving it somewhere else. Fortunately it's both mirrored and has duplicated features so one could scan the right portion and mirror the 3d model to fix the original piece with a printed piece or partial casting; with this piece one could actually just split the model in half and mirror the entire unit as needed. Some of the final model outputs had crazy polygon counts - one generating a 10gb OBJ file. The relief uploaded is a much smaller scale with the resolution dropped; flattened the back as best for printing. Some additional work would be needed to keep/over-emphasize the undercuts and engravings in the metalwork allowing it to remain intact when rendering final mesh as well as when downsizing the OBJ file for traditional 3D printing/CNC machining. Some post processing of the original images in a batch to modify levels/contrast and sharpness in the image is needed. Shooting outdoors in this setting was challenging at the time due to cloud cover changing, overhanging branches at that time caused shadows in the periphery, complexity of the details in the relief and size of the sculpture.",33969,onebitpixel

Owing no allegiance to any formal government, the gloomn are a nomadic people, having long-since abandoned their planet for the open stars. Though most gloomn fear change, they tend to be quite social, even outside of their own species.

0,13616,Gorgan (Random Alien in 18mm scale),"Summary The Wayfarer Random Alien Generator is LIVE! The following alien was generated with a click of a button... and then I made a model. If you play Wayfarer: Things Beyond Wonder, this is a pretty invaluable tool for coming up with aliens to populate your hub-worlds and intergalactic saloons and what have you. GORGAN The gorgan, a sapient species living on the third planet of the Calidraxi System, have adapted to the harsh, subpolar environment they inhabit, sporting a thick layer of insulation beneath their leathery skin along with a tough, honeycombed carapace that assists in defense against the elements and would-be predators. Walking upright on two reticulated legs, the gorgan rely on their massive size and eight clawed tentacles to crush and rend their prey. Ten further tentacles may extend from orifices in a rotund sac suspended from the abdomen which are used as manipulators and aid in climbing the steep cliff sides endemic to the region. The gorgan societal structure is divided into feudal clans where the largest and strongest rule by force. Beta gorgan are kept in a slave-caste, and are used to build the ships, towns, and various infrastructures belonging to a warlord's clan. Due to their extremely social nature and their general lack of ego, gorgan tend to accept their place in society and rarely up-rise against their leadership unless a stronger specimen has made a claim. Gorgan clans have an aggregate Bronze Age level of technical advancement (Tech Level 1), though those that dwell outside the clan structures live in Stone Age or animalistic conditions. Gorgan reproduce asexually, laying globs of gelatinous, spheroid eggs in densely insulated nests. Adolescence is a dangerous time for a gorgan, as only one in a 1,000 hatchlings will see maturity. Born with a thick layer of fur-like filaments, a mature gorgan slowly sheds these and molts as the carapace begins to form. Although distrustful of rival clans, the gorgan have shown themselves to be receptive to otherworldly visitors, several clans having established trade with Separatist mining operations and Zytari world-scouts.

All of the models here are intact, so if you want the split versions (which is how we generally print them) you'll want to go to the original pages. Otherwise, you'll need supports to print them. These were designed for 18mm scale gaming, so the detail on a lot of these isn't up to standard 28mm par, but if you want some quick 28mm (or ""Heroic"") scale figures, just increase the size by 166.6%. We'll continue to update this page whenever we add a new model to the verse, and if you want to design models to add to this collection, shoot us a message and an STL so we can check it out: QUICK DESIGN GUIDELINES: In general, we use round bases, 15mm for an average human-sized character, and 2mm high. The best thing to do is compare your piece to an existing model from this collection to get the scale right. Original designs only (don't copy someone else's work without their permission or submit models of copywritten characters). If we use your piece, we'll give you credit and link to your original page here on Thingiverse. Also, if you like all the free stuff we make and want to support our efforts, drop a pledge to our Patreon page! Enjoy! Post-Printing Splitting the models in halves allows them to be put into more dynamic poses and you'll get the highest level of detail (provided you don't mind a slight seam.) When you're printing these models in halves, you'll want a good and flat razor blade (like the disposable kinds that go into a quality box cutter) to pop them off the plate. Some will pull right off, but models with spears or swords sticking out or the like, you'll want to take care. Once you have them off the plate, a use a little model glue to assemble them. It generally helps to glue one side and line them up standing on their bases. How I Designed This All of these models were designed in Sculptris, TinkerCAD, or more often a combination of the two.

0,13706,R.M.H. (Recessed Modular Habitat),"Summary The Recessed Modular Habitat is designed to utilize the greatest amount of material resources natively available on Mars, in order to minimize the supplies to be transported, thus minimizing cost. There are a number of primary concerns that must be addressed when planning a long-term mission to a hostile environment; the most obvious of these are the need for water, air, and food. Secondary concerns are related mainly to the specific environment that we are focusing on, and include temperature control, the ability to generate non fuel-derived power, and providing for some defense against the intense weather experienced on the surface of the planet. We will discuss proposed solutions to these concerns, each in turn, in the outline below. The proposed mission would take place in two phases, comprising two separate launches, approximately two years apart, to coincide with optimal Martian launch windows. During Phase 1, the first rocket would carry equipment, a load of elemental sodium, potassium nitrate, communications equipment, and a set of five robots. A landing site would be chosen to satisfy the overlap of two basic conditions: Proximity to a polar region with significant quantities of ice, and a region with some notable geothermal activity. Upon landing at a satisfactory site, the robots would set about constructing the habitat. Robot1 would be tasked with boring three large cylinders into the martian landscape; these cylinders would be about twenty feet across, and ten feet deep. These recesses will form the superstructure of the three rooms of our habitat. This format was chosen, because, by lowering the habitat below the surface, it becomes at once robustly insulated, as well as impervious to wind storms. As this process is taking place, Robot2 will gather a large supply of ice from the nearby ice fields. This ice will be melted down and mixed with our sodium to form sodium hydroxide, and hydrogen. The hydrogen will be captured for short-term power generation, and the sodium hydroxide will be mixed with the ferric oxide from the nearby excavation. A generator will burn our hydrogen fuel to produce electricity, with will in turn be used to electrolyse our chemical mixture to produce pure powdered iron. Robot3 will be disassembling the landing module, reconfiguring it into a set of rails, and an electric furnace and manufacturing setup. Once Robot1 has finished with its first hole, Robot4 will descend into the hole as Robot1 exits it. Robot4 is designed to burrow a narrow tunnel straight down to whatever geothermal hotspot was apparent when choosing the landing site, installing behind it a pair of sectional pipes. Robot4 is designed to remain at the bottom of these exchange pipes, and act as a control valve. This pipe-laying process is the first step in designating this first room as the eventual home of the geothermal steam turbine, or ""power plant"" of the habitat. (Geothermal has been chosen because dust, dust-storms, and a significant distance form the sun make solar power impractical. Wind generation is not necessarily consistent or reliable, and would risk breaking down in the strong martian winds. Geothermal is constant, low-maintenance, and highly reliable). As Robot1 starts on the second cylinder, Robot2 will gather a second load of ice. Robot3 will unpack and install the steam turbine atop the geothermal piping, and when Robot2 returns, water will be fed into the system to initiate closed-cycle steam generation, and bring on-site power online. Robot3 will connect the factory setup to the power supply, as Robot2 loads the iron powder into it, for melting. Robot3 will boil a mixture of water, potassium nitrate, and sodium hydroxide to create a chemical sealant to be applied to the iron. At this point Robot5, which is essentially just a nozzle attached to a large robotic crane arm, would begin extruding the molten iron, like a 3d-printer, across the surface of an inflatable dome-mold, to create the roof-caps of our three rooms. each cap has a circular hole in the top of it where a hatch will be installed a bit later. Once the domes are moulded, Robot3 will apply a coat of sealant to each one, while Robot2 lays sections of railing across our newly dug holes. This railing will be used after the second rocket has arrived, as support as the domes are slid across the open holes to form subterranean (or sub-martian, as the case may be) rooms. Robot1 will then burrow connecting tunnels between the three rooms, and the superstructure of our habitat will be complete! In Phase 2, a second rocket will contain the team of scientists, dehydrated food supplies, lab equipment, and furnishings for the RMH. Once the team has landed, they will go about finishing the interiors of the habitat. Of the three rooms, only the power plant is already complete. The team will drop an inflatable lining into the other two rooms, one of which will become the laboratory, the other of which will become the living quarters. Bunks, dining facilities, lab equipment, and bio-waste recycling equipment will be installed into the habitat, and power will be routed throughout. Doors and hatches will be installed next, and finally, the domes will be slid into place, and the habitat will be complete, and ready to live in. Sodium hydroxide produced during Phase 1 will be integrated into the air scrubbers, also generating a supply of sodium bicarbonate to be used for waste-water filtration.

It was this decision that turned the tide in the Orthion's favor, though in doing so, they unwittingly unleashed a source of barbaric savagery into the galactic community. To this age, the Skahl identify as tribes rather than as a species, and are valued in military campaigns fought beyond the domain of the Concordance. Many Skahl follow a rigid, warrior code, and even those allied within the Galactic Concordance are feared for their brashness and stubborn-minded adherence to the ways of warfare.""

In the stygian darkness beyond, a faint glimmer could be seen, hovering motes without tell of depth. Soon a flutter could be heard, soft at first, then rising to a cacophonous flurry, the once-dim motes now given form. They poured from that empty place, taking the worst aspects of bats, jellyfish, and ticks, their luminescent skin betraying the pulsing shapes of their strange, internal biology. Screeching in a sound born beyond the stars, they tore, stung, and bit until there were none left to give witness save the phantom eyes of the automated surveillance footage.""

0,13764,Pocket-Tactics: Summoner's Dial,"Summary This is an accessory for Pocket-Tactics forces that include Conjured units: Conjured Units: When a unit has a parenthetical value attached to their cost, this means that the unit must be Conjured. This value does not affect the base point value of the unit, though is used to bring the Conjured unit to the map (see below). Conjured units may not be brought to the map through the base tile and are not considered to be in reserves. Rather, they are kept in the Aether Queue and require a Summoner's Dial to be summoned. At the beginning of the match, your Summoner's Dial starts at Zero. Each round you activate a unit with at least one Magic OFF dice to do a move action, you may turn the Summoner's Dial clockwise a single value. Once the Summoner's Dial has reached a value equal to or greater than the Comjuration cost of the unit (the Cost value in parenthesis), you may, instead of summoning or activating another unit, turn the dial counter-clockwise a number of values equal to the Conjuration cost and bring a Conjured unit to the map. The conjured unit may enter any unoccupied tile adjacent to an allied unit with a minimum of one Magic OFF dice. As with a normal summon, the unit being conjured is not subject to hazard effects when it is summoned into a hazard tile. When a Conjured unit is defeated, rather than go to enemy captures, it is returned to the Aether Queue and may be summoned again, provided the terms for conjuration can be met.

Of course, either faction from this set can play against any of the factions from the first two, just as every future set will be compatible. We're really excited by the prospect of an ever-expanding universe of factions and locales from all genres (though we're going to thoroughly mine Fantasy first).

I printed them all one piece at a time, though you can feel free to try and print bricks of them. I had trouble doing so and it was probably due to my calibration.

The rules are in super-beta mode (just finished writing them last night) so expect typos and confusion, but throw me some feedback and I can answer questions/clean up the document as we go.

0,13806,Sandwich Shaped Sandwich Cutter (Uncrustable),"Summary This isn't really a remix, it is more of an evolution of the ""Uncrustable"" maker. The original version is round by bill84, followed by the square version by Istale which wasted less of the sandwich. The next step of course was to make the cutout sandwich shaped, for the least possible waste. Of course, depending on the bread you buy it may or may not fit your bread exactly. You could of course scale it to match your bread size, but if you scale down make sure to print the 2 parts separately. In it's current scale it is designed for both parts to be printed together, there is a 0.5mm gap between them so if you scale down you could have problems with the 2 parts welding together.

I was originally going to mix Kim Jong Un with the body of a baby but couldn't find one so a Barbie body was my next choice. Good luck if you try and print this, Kim is wearing really high heels so it will probably be a tough print. I have included the meshmixer file if you want to try and modify it for better printing.

0,13813,"Printrbot Simple 1405 ""TRI ROD MOD"" with or without XL tower upg","Summary This mod adds a third linear rod in both the Y and Z axes. The third rod greatly reduces the amount of twisting that can occur, especially with an extended Y mod installed. This mod is based off of Jon Lawrence's 300mm no sag mod. It also includes modifications to a couple of other's works which I will list in the remixed from area. UPDATE (12/13/2014): After printing out the model for the ""TRI_ROD_MOD_TOP1_XL"", I found out it didn't fit because the models for the XL wood parts were not correct. I have measured my actual wooden XL parts and have redesigned this part to now fit correctly. I also beefed it up a bit. UPDATE(2/13/2015): I uploaded a new step file with just the parts for the non XL version. I also have separate step files for the 2 biggest parts. I verified that these can be imported with FreeCad. P.S. I will try and work out a basic hardware list sometime soon. P.P.S. I am also working on another version of this mod that will be integrated into the ""JONbot"". Nothing from this version will be compatible. The XL tower parts will also be integrated and are printed, no wood parts will be used at all. UPDATE (FEB/15/2015): I have modified all of the big parts to be printable on a 100 x 100 print area. There is a new STEP file with all of the 100x100 printable parts as well as STL files of each. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpEauZWP_l4 Instructions I'l eventually add something here, just wanted to get the files up in case anyone wants to experiment.

Please note: the center to center distance of the carriage joints must be the same as the effectors otherwise the effector will not move across the bed in a plane. Please ask questions as I don't know what information is missing for others to reproduce this. Instructions Please visit the following website for more information http://www.appropedia.org/Auto-Clearance_Adjustable_Triple_Hotend_Effector The key to this design that can be adapted to any other hot end is that the hotend is held by the 0.015 of an inch spring in which the z height is controlled by the two grub screws that act as stops. the spring was cut with tin scissors although it would have been much easier with punches.",37212,Nick Dubiel

0,13837,The Convenient Typer,"Summary This is an apparatus designed to allow three people to conveniently type out a specific phrase: it is as it is Each person must time their actions specifically, and operate their portion of the device with care. This device was made to be a performance at a local art-event. Its operation is (of course) far from convenient, but it does type out the most true thing I have ever known. Instructions I am sorry, but I did not take enough pictures, and in general, I am not sure if I could communicate how this device was built. I have included for you every part that I 3-d printed, as well as the .blend file, which contains a scale model of the typewriter, and all of the printed components in their functional positions. I do believe you would be able to reverse engineer the device by examining the .blend file. However, if their is interest, then I will do my best to draft a step by step set of build instructions. Some notes: The 3D parts with a letter in their title (S-gear.stl for example) correspond to the letter on the typewriter with which that part interacts. The exceptions are the parts with ""L"" or ""R"" in the title...those correspond with ""Left"" or ""Right"". Also note: ""I-gear"" and similar parts have two teeth side by side, but I ended up reducing that (with a saw) to one. To type out the word three people (or an individual with long arms) must use the two word handles, and the space bar presser with specific timing. The correct timing is as follows: Type 2 letters with the right handle, space bar, type one letter with the right handle, one letter with the left, space bar, type two letters with the left handle, space bar, and repeat. These openscad scripts were used: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3575 http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5505 I have attached to this thing my (slightly) modified versions of the above scripts. sidenote: after re-reading these instructions...I don't see how any most of it will make sense to anybody.....here is my apology in Red Dwarf form: http://youtu.be/ns4kgvOzopI?t=6m56s",37262,ginggeli

0,13839,The Automatic Affirmation Device,"Summary The Automatic Affirmation Device only has one thing to say: YES. Will today be a good day? Will I pass that exam? Is this the best idea I ever had ever? YES. The Automatic Affirmation Device is your own personal confidence booster that is never wrong. This is designed to be a gift, the perfect gift, (for you to give) to someone who is in need of some caring reassurance. Instructions The Box itself Print out all three sections of the box: -The Base (Base-Battery-slider.stl) -The Lower Section of the Box (Lower-section.stl) -The Top Section of the Box (Top-section.stl) Attach the top and bottom sections of the box to each-other. Be sure to carefully align the sections so that the front face (where YES is displayed) has a clean seam. I affixed the two sections together using ABS glue, but I imagine Hot Glue would also work. The YES Screen When the interior light is activated this is the 'screen' on which 'YES' will be displayed. As shown in The YES Screen Components image http://www.thingiverse.com/image:47017 there are three basic elements you will need to make/find: -A small piece of paper with the word yes cut out of it. Once cut, I painted mine with acrylic paint so that it would not let as much light through the paper. (I included a YES graphic in the list of images for this thing, but i don't know if that is actually making things easier for you...it's not hard to design yours better than mine and the size of 'YES' will vary with the box size) -A small piece of tissue paper. Yellow or Green will work well. -A green coloured piece of plastic (You could use coloured acetate, for mine I printed out a green rectangle onto an overhead projector sheet). the outer size of these sheets should be about 46mm x 23mm, but that will vary depending on the size you printed your box (just make it small enough to fit inside of your box, but large enough to have something to glue on to the box interior). The word YES should be small enough be visible through the tiny window on the front of the box. Using a glue stick, or some rubber cement, affix the tissue paper to one side of your green coloured piece of plastic. With the plastic side of the screen facing downward, affix your paper with 'YES' cut out onto the tissue paper side of the screen. when glueing down the 'YES' paper, the word should appear backwards as seen in the image of the box's interior http://www.thingiverse.com/image:47018 You can now glue the 'YES' screen on to the interior of the box as seen in the previous image. Note that plastic side of the screen is facing the outside of the box. Note that I painted the interior of the box with acrylic paint to prevent light from escaping. The Electronics The electronics are very simple, and are wired as follows: With some copper wire connect one lead of the battery to one pole of the bulb holder. Connect the other lead of the battery to one pole of the momentary switch (note: depending on the type of switch you purchased you may have to attach these wires after the switch is mounted in the box...which is tricky, but doable). Connect the remaining poles of the of the lamp and momentary switch to eachother. Sidenote: As a simple as the electronics are I am sorry if I completely failed to properly articulate the steps. Also, I am sorry if I insulted your intelligence by trying to carefully explain what is a pretty bare bones circuit. As an exercise for myself I attached a schematic image onto this thing...I understand that schematics are easy for most people to read...but they always pose a difficulty for me. The extremely simple schematic I attached is the first one I have made that is not a collection of arrows and squiggly lines, handwritten on a piece of crumpled paper, that I eventually misplace. Finish it up Once your switch is mounted into the box, and the battery compartment is hot glued on to the Base Battery Slider, and the 'YES' screen is glued onto the interior of the box, you are pretty close to being done! You just have to mount the light in place. My way is not the best way, this is what I did: I glued a small dowel on to the interior top of the box, and used that to pivot/position the beam of the light, which was then hot glued into place. It was a little finicky, and maybe your derivitave will include a light mounting thing in the top-section.stl ;) In my own box I meant to use AAA instead of AA batteries, but I only had one size of battery holder on hand (You will find that I often trade a patient solution with a quick solution, for better or worse). With the smaller batteries you will likely have more options for light mounting and battery positioning. Also, I only had a prefocused light on hand, which isn't the best in this situation. To increase the spread of the light I put a dab of hot glue on the lights tip (you will also find that I solve ALOT of problems with hot glue) to properly diffuse the light. Also note that the battery compartment is glued close to the front of the Base Battery Slider: http://www.thingiverse.com/image:47019 AND THERE YOU HAVE IT! YOUR AUTOMATIC AFFIRMATION DEVICE IS BORN Operation Ask the device a question that you need to be positively reassured about. 2.Press the momentary switch on the top of the device. It will only tell you the truth. Presentation When you give these devices as gifts to your friends and family it is important that you believe in them. You absolutely need to take on the role of artist/magician/TV Infomercia",37262,ginggeli

Casa Batlló is a renowned building located in the center of Barcelona, Spain, and is one of Antoni Gaudí’s masterpieces, finished in 1904. The local name for the building is Casa dels ossos (House of Bones), as it has a visceral, skeletal organic quality. Like everything Gaudí designed, it is only identifiable as Modernisme or Art Nouveau in the broadest sense. The façade is decorated with a colorful mosaic made of broken ceramic tiles. The roof is arched and was likened to the back of a dragon (Wikipedia).

0,13936,Filament Sample Chip - Business Card Style," We have put together here, an excellent way to manage your filament samples!
 Are you tired of hiking around from friend to friend, client to client or around the house with filament chips on a string or scattered everywhere? Do you even remember which chip is which filament?
 Why not make your filament samples into business card sized pieces and store them neatly in a business card clear binder insert found at your local office supply stores.
 We've produced these sample chips with the following dimensions, [L-85mm;H-47mm;W-5mm] & 5mm radius corners to help with inserting the chips into the binder insert slots. Keep in mind that these chips are designed to be slightly smaller than your typical business card. This is due to their added thickness and we needed to be able to insert and remove them from the sleeves as needed.
The chips come with 4 ""Windows"" used to show the transparency features of each filament. The windows, from left to right are the following thickness', [1mm;2mm;3mm;4mm]
As can be seen in the sample images, we've added descriptive text to each chip we currently have samples of.
How we label our chips:
 What we like to do with our samples is to ensure we have a descriptive label on each. With these labels we can determine the basics of each filament and with the included number system we can lookup the brand, purchase price and what ever else you've kept a record of for each roll!
The first part of our labels includes the filaments color. We tend to keep this to one abbreviated word, sometimes two words.
Secondly, We add in our filament type [ex. ABS, PLA, T-Glass, Wood] Again, trying to keep it as short as possible
Lastly, we add in our numbers. We keep them to 2 digits giving us plenty of space down the road for more of the same color/type filaments.
In a separate book is where we keep the same label information as well as additional beneficial information such as filament manufacturer, spool price, purchase location and even printer settings. Making consistency much easier.
Printing the chips:
Printing is pretty simple for these samples. No supports necessary. As your labels increase in information the need to print fine detail around the labels will be needed.
Summary:
Stop lugging around your sample chips on a string, falling out of your pockets or lost forever under some couch! Using these chips and storage method you can have organization and the ease of transporting your chips around for yourself and potential clients, we all know how much they are impressed by seeing what filament choices are out there!! Make it count!

0,13945,POCKET TOOL GRINDER,"Summary Having built the POCKET WOOD LATHE and the tools from sewing machine needles I needed something to sharpen them on hence this tool was conceived. So this is the second tool in my pocket series, it is based on my POCKET WOOD LATHE http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1092972 Centered on using the the same head-stock as in the wood lathe, the rest of the tools will be based around the same style. The bearing on the head-stock can be fitted to the lathe, as I found the shaft has a tendency to float back and forth, so this fixes that problem.

0,13946,POCKET WOOD LATHE,"Summary This is a rework of Crayon Lathe 2 | Open Source TOYS by theevilorverlord. I ended up importing the stl files into my cad software and used them as a base. I wanted a simple wood lathe for turning 1:76.2 or 00 or 4mm to the foot. This design was a good place to start, The head-stock is the same accept I have a direct drive motor for more speed, went to 8mm rods. The tail-stock have used another head stock for future customization. The saddle and tool rest a based on my big wood lathe. All was printed in ABS rod holes had to be cleaned out to fit the rods. 2015-10-27 added some low poly stl files of handles for the sewing machine needles. I used the 2 part ones and glued together the a mix of acetone and ABS, then opened the hole up to about 1.8mm the warmed the needle and pushed it into the hole. 2015-11-01 Added link to the next in my pocket series of tools a pocket tool grinder to sharpen the tools for this lathe. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1103842 PARTS LIST HEAD-STOCK x2 SADDLE x 1 TOOL-REST 1 4mm cap screws x 2 3mm cap screws x 16 8mm rod 2 pieces of desired length 6mm rod to bend up for tool rest motor to suit chuck ( I got mine from Banggood.com )",37629,TIMBOLOGIST

0,13954,Coyote OYO alternative mount for Renault Captur,"Summary The mounting system that comes with the Coyote OYO driving assistant only allows dashboard mounting. This means that leaving the device on the dashboard in in some public places is an invitation to bad experiences. So I devised a holder that allows to place the Oyo in a more discrete location: under the central console, while still remaining clearly visible for the driver. A pair of 30x10x3mm magnets in the base device and the holder provide strong retention, allow to quickly remove the Oyo and the holder by just pulling on them and also provides some security if the Oyo is accidentally pushed aside by a passenger. The base could be fixed under the central console with a pad of adhesive foam. A series of slots in the vertical portion of the holder allows flexion to ease the insertion of the Oyo. Sketchup files are provided should you want to modify the holder or the base to change the angles...

GroupHex is an evolution of the ubiquitous Honey comb pattern or the Hexagon shaped organizer. Taking a step forward from a fixed layout (like: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1092812) I designed GroupHex with 3 goals in mind: It should be relatively quick to print, Should be expandable and fun.
GroupHex comes in four sizes: Short, Medium, Tall and Grande. There are 3 grooves and 3 ribs on the 6 sides of the Hexagon. These allow GroupHex units to be linked together at different relative heights, allowing the user to make their own unique Organizer, different from anyone else. There is another groove at the bottom of each unit allowing even more flexibility in linking the units in Horizontal and Vertical Orientation.",36433,shubham.mankhand

0,13958,Replacement Drawer Roller,"Summary A friend at work had an old drawer with a broken runner wheel. The manufacturer no longer makes them. What a perfect situation for a 3D printer! I modeled the existing wheel in Autodesk's 123D Design using nothing but cylinders of various sizes, using the Combine/Merge and Combine/Subtract tools. I chamfered the edges of the wheel, but realized after printing the first prototype it wasn't enough, so added more and the second prototype looked good. I added the screw pocked on one side so when screwed to the bracket, the head will have some recessed room to hide in. The wheel measures 28.2mm in diameter, with a 7mm hole in the center. The projection on the side is 5.26mm.Print Settings Rafts: NoSupports: NoResolution: .2mmInfill: 100% Notes: Printed with Taulman 910 Alloy Nylon, so it should last forever - How I Designed This: Designed in 123D Design.

0,13974,Z Probe removable module - for manual leveling E3D,"Summary I don't like idea of calibrating leveling every time before printing. Glass bed is usually very stable after one calibration Auto correction takes controllers CPU time to correct Z values and decrease printing quality and speed. My idea is to make perfect calibration once, with glass bed, fix it, and check its leveling after some time. This module allows you to make level calibration as perfect as possible by using Bed height map option of Repetier-host. Mount micro switch, without leaver, to this module and attach module to the hotend when you want to make calibration. Connect switch to Zmin connection and modify firmware to enable Z probe. I am using Repetier-firmware with RAMPS1.4 and Z probe is on pin 18. Manual calibration can be achieved by modifying Tower X,Y,Z endstop offsets values in EPROM. Just play little bit with values, and after every change re-test Bed height map. If you getting lower difference between lowest and highest value, you are on right path. You do not need to change all tree offsets, just two of them. Once you get difference about 0.1-0.2 between lowest and top values, consider leveling done. Finally, I always confirm my level calibration with large test like this. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:702690 WARNING: Do NOT power hotend while module is still attached. Module is optimized for E3Dv6 hotend. It is 6mm below hotend nozzle.
