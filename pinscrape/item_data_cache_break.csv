0,15504,AG Thumb Sticks (Taranis/Spektrum),"The stock sticks on a radio (both the DX8 and Taranis) don't cut it for me. The biggest problem I have with them is that they are too thin and don't grip on my thumb and index finger. There are two types of pilots: thumbers and pinchers. I have been both, and the stock sticks don't help either of these styles of flying. There is definately room for improvement.
The AG Thumb Sticks grip your thumb, and the index finger rolls nicely in the groove. Once you try them, your race lap times will be faster. Highly recommended upgrade to your original sticks.
I have personally tested them on a Taranis, DX8 and DX9
You can choose either the plain sticks (""AG Thumb Stick_noLOGO"") or the one with the letter ""A"" logo (""AG Thumb Stick_withLOGO""). The plain version feels smoother on the finger tip, but the LOGO version provides better grip.
I like both versions. For my flying style, I used the plain stick on the left (throttle) stick. And I used the LOGO stick on the right (cyclic) stick.
UPDATE:
People asked me for a shorter version than the original ones I uploaded. So I've uploaded another STL file called ""AG Thumb Stick_shortversion"". It's good for pilots who prefer a longer throw. Shorter sticks gives you less sensitive movement... and longer sticks makes it more agile. For FPV racing, I prefer to be able to cover the full range of stick movement quickly and with ease (I find loosening the gimbals so there is less tension helps too) that's why I prefer the original length of AG Thumb Sticks. (the original length also gives a more comfortable space for your index finger)
Where I do prefer this shorter version is when you fly with just your thumbs. I still fly helicopters this way, and find the shorter version is much better for this type of flying.

0,15505,Teak Temple - Wat Pan Tao,"Welcome to Chiang Mai, Thailand! 
This temple fully built with teak dates back to the 14th century! Set in a compound full of fluttering orange flags, the monastery is a monument to the teak trade, with an enormous prayer hall supported by 28 teak pillars and lined with dark teak panels, enshrining a particularly graceful gold Buddha image. The juxtaposition of the orange monks' robes against this dark backdrop during evening prayers is particularly sublime (Lonely Planet, http://www.lonelyplanet.com/thailand/chiang-mai-pr...

0,15507,Modern Combat 5 - Sticky Mine,"I love to play Modern Combat 5 Blackout on my mobile phone. And recently got into Airsoft and wanted to make a stick mine based off the game that I could use for Airsoft. So here it is. Also included is a PAL/MOLLE plate to magnetically mount to a chest rig or other compatible components.
Included are there files. The Sticky Mine plain and one with large built in brim for ABS printing (only way I could get it to print without warping), and the PAL/MOLLE rig mount.
I used these magnets to stick to metal and to rig mount, but most 1/2"" Neodymium Rare-Earth Magnet Discs should work. 
Magnet Qty-4 for the Sticky Mine  
Magnet Qty-2 for the rig mount.
You may also noticed in the picture of the bottom I used a stick pad so that this sticky mine truly sticks to anything. While not required it makes the mine truly sticky.
Please use/print responsible. While this is a toy, it may appear real to many people. Do not attempt to place or handle in public but only under the care of a mature adult in a mil-sim environment. ",957,mtnbiker
0,15508,Turning gears with base... low-volume version,"This is a much lower-volume version of my original design.  The base has hollowed-out sections on the bottom to reduce filament use, and those sections have rounded corners to reduce jogging stress on your machine while printing.  (Sharp corners are harder on CNC machines than nice, gentle ones.)  The mounting posts have also been changed to a much larger diameter, and have a 0.1"" hole for a wood screw and large washer to hold the gears in place.  The walls of the gears are only 0.8mm thick (twice the size of my nozzle), to reduce printing time and filament use, but the bottom side of the gears is 0.5315"" thick for strength and stability. This model is also a bit smaller than my previous one, and was made specifically to fit on my 7.8"" x 7.8""  print bed, with a bit of room to spare.   Also, you might notice that I made one gear shorter than the other on this model.  This required tweaking the twist radius of the extrusion, in order for the gears to mesh properly... but I thought it added a nice touch.  My printer is very busy right now, or I'd be printing this object... but I will post images of it, once I'm able to print it.",42442,clint_campbell

0,15510,Santa's New Sleigh,"Santa’s New Sleigh (by Richard Swika)
Santa’s reindeer retired,
No longer up to the task,
Old they still could fly,
Just not very fast.
They’d sometimes get lost,
Or misplace their antlers,
“We don’t use reindeer anymore,
Drones can get there faster”.
And as you know,
Tardiness is NOT fine,
Santa can’t be late,
He’s always on time.
And so it was proclaimed and agreed,
An executive order,
From the head elf indeed!
“Elves, go to the garage and build a new sled,
Pulled by 8 powerful pistons instead.”
“Fuel it with nitrous,
Gas, nog, and wi-fi,
Make sure it can drive,
It can ski,
And of course,
It can fly.”
“It must go supersonic,
Then turn on a dime.
And be nimble enough,
To land on a pine.”
“The sleigh must be warmed,
With a nuclear heater,
So no matter how cold,
It’ll melt through the snow,
In any bad weather,
With just the nose glow,
That way the sleigh’s,
Always ready to go.”
“It has to be able,
To shrink and to grow,
To any size Santa’s needs,
On his job while he goes.
He might need it small,
To fit through a crack.
Or as large as the moon,
To go very fast.”
No danger or doubt,
Come snow, hail, rain or ice,
Making deliveries for Santa,
Now will be very nice.
By 3D printed contraption,
On Christmas Eve night,
Circumventing the globe in your new sled Saint Nick,
Have a wonderful flight!
Message from Richard
Some of my fondest memories revolve around building of plastic models, always received in ample supply as Christmas gifts as a kid. I hope this model brings the same joy of the holidays to you and your family. I really enjoyed working on this project and I hope you have a great Christmas. Happy Holidays!
Organized into build plates by color, so you can build this model without painting. Requires little support and clean up. There are assembly tabs and guides on most parts, making it a fun and easy build. Once printed, everything goes together fast with super glue.
Assembly Instructions
Interactive Assembly Animation on Sketchfab
Assembly Sequence on Youtube
You’ll build this model just like the elves did in Santa’s shop, starting with the frame rails and working your way up. You’ll build and install a detailed V8 engine, powertrain components, front end, ski, sleigh, stand, and Jolley ol’ Saint Nick himself. The whole kit contains over 80 detailed parts. Everything is modeled right down to the bolts on the engine parts, to Santa’s eye brows. All of the parts were designed from scratch for successful 3d printing and ease of assembly.
Includes tested S3D factory files for each build plate, optimized, tested and proven to produce beautiful results on typical home 3D printers.
Printing
I developed and tested the project using S3D and have provided the factory files containing all of the settings and support you need for a successful print in ABS. You will have to adjust the settings for PLA, PET, and so on. The plates are designed to print in a few hours each, on average.
For other slicers, I’ve provided stl files for each build plate. You’ll need to add support as needed. Please see the parts list for guidance. ",17368,richard_swika

0,15534,R2D2 Non Electronic Version,"Please watch this video for more information: https://youtu.be/hH4L06uxcRU
The survey for my next project has been closed. I'll have a video posted shortly detailing the winner and my plans to create it!
This is the non electronic version of the R2-D2 robot I created here: https://pinshape.com/items/15477-3d-printed-r2d2-t...
I removed all of the parts specific to holding electronic components, and instead of using screws to hold the whole thing together, I made little cylindrical connectors. You can see those in the ""extras"" file.
The tallest ones are used to connect the body to the arms/legs. The mid sized ones are used to connect the butt plate to the middle leg. The smaller ones are used to connect the body to the butt plate. These connectors should be pretty tight so they'll probably hold pretty well but some simple glue will make them stick together if it's not staying.
The head will just slide on, and once you turn it, it should fall into a groove so the head can rotate but it shouldn't fall off easily.
Also I have not actually printed this myself, so let me know if there are any issues while you're trying to print and I'll attempt to fix them. But everything should be printable at 0.3mm layer height and all the supports needed are already on the models. Also this model should be scalable to some degree. The pegs make it hard to do so, but you should be fine downsizing it a bit.

0,15545,Split Chassis Plates for OpenRC F1,"Everything in the OpenRC F1 project by Daniel Norée was printable on my Lulzbot Mini 3D printer aside from the Front and Rear chassis plates.
I had to make a modification to the chassis plates in order to get them to print. Because I was making this model as a display unit, I did not have to take into account the placement of electronics and so on. I also thought about gluing the plates back together but I decided on using the same hardware as needed to assemble the project.
The bed of my printer is 6""x6"" and all of the split chassis plates fit.
Each hole was counter sunk on the underside like each of the other holes for the project assembly. I had no issues printing these split chassis plates and they snapped together as they should once I was done! They also appear to be very strong still. You could glue and bolt the half's together if you'd like. I just used the bolts.
Hardware Needed:
4x M3x8mm Machine Screws
4x M3 Hex Nuts
Instructions:
You will need to print 1 of each part. There are 2 parts per chassis plate (front/rear). You will have 4 parts in total.
Assemble with M3x8mm screws and M3 nuts. The same used all over the project for assembly.
Snap the front chassis plate into the rear chassis plate using the 45/45 joint
ENJOY!!
* These chassis plates are a modification of the ones supplied with the OpenRC Formula 1 project. The project can be found here.
* As of December 21, 2015, these plates have not been tested with the electronics needed to make this a Radio Controlled car and they have only been used for a Formula 1 display model.",36981,Chris Halliday

I design this to be rocket ship playhouse. The top cover and main compartment of the rocket can be rotated or exchange  with any compartment designs (control room, bedroom, engine room etc). Same goes with the cover (antenna, satelite dish, etc).
The top can be remove to fit another chamber. Multiple compartments! They have slots at the bottom of the compartments so they wont fall off.
I'm designing different chambers and expansion compartments.
Printing: I used PLA.
1. I used support for the cover. (It should print fine without support, speed is key). Others don't need supp. 2. I printed the mount with 1 layer wall 10% infill. Lower the print speed at the up curve. This helps retain the up curve shape.(mine was a bit wobbly, not cooling fast enough).
3. Make sure the the print sticks flat to the platform. So that the grove and the holes of chamber and lid are aligned.
4. The mount, thrusters and boosters are all glued.

0,15597,Teach a child to tell the time,"The teaching clock can be a an interesting 3D printing project as it works as a teaching aid on 2 levels.
The first is the obvious one, to teach young children to tell the time using a clock rather than reading the time from their phone. The second is that it uses a novel mechanism to create the 12:1 ratio between the Hour and Minute hands. A description of the Ferguson paradox can be found here
http://www.woodenclocks.co.uk/page72.html
on my woodenclocks website.
This is a simple build with no requirements for supports, only some adjustment to get the right fits on the main shaft.
The teaching Clock can be held using the round handle on the back, by either the teacher or the child, the hands can be turned to a time by the teacher to ask the child, or the child can turn the hands to answer the teacher's question.

These are traditional holiday ornaments. You can add a little hook or string through the loop hole to hang them on anything you'd like. My wife and I also painted these ones. We'll have a video up shortly that will go into more detail on the process we took. But at a high level, we sanded them using medium to ultra-fine grit sand paper, then we sprayed plastic primer on them, then added a coat of whatever color of spray paint you want. We chose mostly silver and gold.
These could be used as a fun craft/art project for kids. Because you can paint them with acrylics as well. So they could paint on their design and they can make their own ornaments while learning about 3D printing.
What you'll need to print them, the file called ""normal-bottom"" is the bottom half. You'll also need to print the connectors. Then you can top half with either the side hanging tab or the top hanging tab. All 3 took me about an hour and a half to print. I printed them at 0.3mm layer height.

0,15637,Light Up Ornaments (Batman & Gears of War),"Please watch this video for more information and to see them in action: https://youtu.be/2W8YSOQ2y48
I had this idea a few days ago and thought they'd be fun to make. These are round ornaments that light up and one has the Batman logo on it and the other has Gears of War. You can light them with any color and in a couple different ways. The video explains a bit more and shows them lighting up.
I've included a couple different options for the bottom part. There is a normal bottom that is just round with no features. The one titled ""string-light-bottom"" has a whole in the bottom that allows a string light (like christmas lights) to be inserted and will light up the clear PLA (see the Batman image above). Then the one titled ""switch-bottom"" is designed if you want to put an LED in there and half it be able to be turned off to preserve the battery. With the LED you can just get a coin cell battery and attach them (a resistor is recommended but not necessary). A little soldering is necessary if you choose to use the switch though.
These were printed using black PLA and clear PLA (http://www.amazon.com/HATCHBOX-Transparent-3D-Printer-Filament/dp/B00M0CS8N2/ref=sr_1_1). They should just snap together and can be hung using string or some ornament hooks you can find at most major retail stores.

This is the clear filament I use: http://www.amazon.com/HATCHBOX-Transparent-3D-Printer-Filament/dp/B00M0CS8N2/ref=sr_1_1
These take about 20 minutes to print each. I can print a batch of 3 in an hour. They should fit without needing any adhesive or other attachment. They will print with no support material. I printed them at 0.3mm layer height.

Note that we included dualprint versions of the strait and curved tracks. This makes it possible to print the sleepers in one colour and the rails in a different colour.
With 2015 coming to an end with this release we want to thank all of you that have encouraged us to release designs and come up with new ideas for future projects.
Merry christmas and a happy new 3D-printing year!

0,15666,Alternative Christmas Card/Frame,"This frame was designed to be used as an alternative to the traditional Christmas card. It can be used to hold a printed version of an electronic card or you can make your own by printing a picture you like and sign the back before giving it to someone (not forgetting to give them the frame too). I gave this to my wife with a selections of pictures so she can change the picture on display whenever she likes. There is enough room to get quite a few pictures in. It could also just be used as a picture frame.
It was printed on a Wanhao Duplicator i3 with a 200 micron layer height. The filament used was MadeSolid PET+ in white. The recommended settings were used with a print speed of 30mm/s. Once all the parts were printed it was glued together. The text was painted and a little glitter added before it dried. This was then stuck in position on the front. This could be made for other occasions by making up alternative text. For my next iteration of this I will make the stands a little steeper as it leans back a bit too much when placed on a high shelf. It is fine on a table or low shelf.
Hope it is useful to others. My wife likes hers and it helps to make the printer seem a little less of a toy!",35438,Watchmaker

0,15730,Titanfall Titan - Atlas Model V2 - scalable and poseable,"SummaryUpdate 4/9/2014: I've updated all of the joints to make assembly easier. You'll understand once you start to assemble this model. The new joints have ""grooves"" that allow you to slide the joint on, then turn to lock into the ball joint. I was super excited when this idea came to me. I've tested the new joints and they work awesome. http://youtu.be/WJXJiYCuqIs The new joints are incorporated into the files marked v2. This guy is epic... He's big, poseable, and ready for war.... Be careful with the joints. They may need a bit of sanding. If you are going to make this guy out of PLA make sure to sand the joints well because they will crack when your putting them together. I toned down the gun a little. It was kinda huge. I added indentions to the balls of the joints to help during assembly. Take your time. Love to hear your comments and suggestions. Thanks. TDInstructionsJoints are now updated for easier assembly. Simply align the slots with the corners of the socket and the ball will slide in easier. Once the ball is in the socket, turn it to lock it into place. The joints are still tight and may need some sanding for a good fit.",48136,Tony D

0,15732,Open Source Minifig - Ghost Ver 4.2 - April 2014,"Summary Update 10/20/2014: I uploaded a new STL for the head. I think it was missing. I'm in the process of double checking this whole figure and updating him. Look for an new version in a few days.... Update 4/19/2014: I enlarged the hip connection .5mm. This should tighten up the hip joint. Update 4/4/2014: I just realized I had the wrong torso file in here. I've fixed it. The arms and hips should fit 10 times better now. Thanks. This is the latest version of my open source figures. I've deleted the older versions to alleviate any confusion. Plus, this guy blows them away... This dude is a ""game changer"". His joints are bomb-proof solid and a world of difference better than the last version. They actually have a split built in for flexibility and are covered for aesthetics. This model can easily be tweaked to work with PLA or ABS. This latest version is optimized for ABS but can work with most materials. Print as is - then sand the ball joints down if they are too tight. OPEN SOURCE - The way this model excels as ""open source"" is that the joints are simply 4mm ball sockets. This enables you to make your own accessories or tweaks. Also the hands are 3.5mm holes so anything with a round peg about 3.4~3.5mm in diameter will fit in his hands securely. All the accessories from my previous models should work with this new figure as well. Please comment and let me know how it prints on your various machines. InstructionsPrint the Hip Joint at 100% fill - Great suggestion from one of the Makers. I print everything else at 10% with walls of 4. I also print with support material, hence why the torso is upside down. The inside joint on the torso prints best upside down.",48136,Tony D

0,15746,Touch Screen Control Panel Enclosure for MKS TFT28 Upgrade,"Since I did not care for the turning select button on my Prusa i3 printer, I ordered a touch screen panel to replace it. I am very happy with the upgrade, it is much faster selecting what I want to do. The screen is very responsive, and was very easy to setup. It can also be expanded to include a WIFI module, and a (2nd) remote SD card reader, and it already includes an input for a USB-stick. Since I have a MKS Base motherboard, I did not even need a power supply, you might check the datasheet for your motherboard. I purchase mine from: http://www.aliexpress.com/store/1047297 but they can also be had from eBay for about $33. I have included the datasheet which has instruction for hookup, bios update, etc. Tip: if your bios update does not seem to take, try reformating your SD card to FAT.
The enclosure itself was designed in SketchUp, and the SKB and DAE files are in the zip file for your modifications, should you choose to do so. I went through 6 iterations to get all dimensions perfect, so it should fit perfectly. You will need 4 * M3x20mm screws, or M3x25mm if you want to use the included brackets. One set of brackets is for free standing on your desk, the other is for clipping onto the Prusa i3's 8mm plexi glass, the other two are for connection on 2020 extruded aluminum. The screw should self-tap into the face plate, so do not over tighten or you will strip it.",42601,Arjen Jonkhart

The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era.[1] Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several genres, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as ""Beatlemania"", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s.

I have made a modification since this print to add another hole in the sides for the zip ties. This uses four of the M5x8 mm bolts and T-Nuts to mount it to the extrusion. You'll need six of the M3x10 mm bolts to mount the 25 mm fans. There is also a version that mounts just a 40 mm fan to the top portion. One of the things I don't like about other RAMPS cases is they don't ever seem to leave you space for the wires. That is why the top portion is totally open in this design.,19977,Pierrimus

0,15777,Idler Pulley Conversion - 525 ZZ Bearing Cobblebot,SummaryI had some bearings leftover from my Cobblebot build and other spare parts. I needed a few Idler pullies for a belt system I was working on so I designed this conversion kit. The 2 outer pieces press fit onto the outside of the bearings and each other to create flanges for a GT2 Timing belt to rest in. I created these because some people felt the larger pulleys created too large of a track for the belt. In some situations this is probably true so this may work better for some people. Be warned all of these are intended to be a very tight fit. I used 0.1mm gap and 0.2mm gap so that the parts would not slide when in use. I assembled mine by hand but you may need a vice or pliers to get everything together. If your printer is not producing mostly round circle or over extruding you might need to clean up the parts to get everything to fit.,14553,Steven Furick

However, unlike a standard box, this has a unique double lid so you can open the main lid without opening both compartments. This makes this design a bit different which we like. 
We were in a hurry so printed with a layer height of 0.25mm and an infill of 10% (plus shell thickness of only 0.4mm) however, for a much better looking print we would suggest a smaller layer height and a higher infill. We printed this using our great blue PLA plastic.

0,15873,Civilian Recurve Bow and Bracer,"SummaryThis is a civilian version of the Faire Play Recurve Bow and Bracer released by Zheng3 to mark his Faire Play Kickstarter reaching the initial fundraising goal. The original bracer is oversize to fit around plate armor. I have remixed the bracer to fit a standard Barbie-style doll arm while maintaining compatibility with the original Recurve Bow. When I attempted to print the original Recurve Bow, even after making some adjustments, my printer hit the hard end stops. I realized the Zheng Industries forges were producing full scale war bows intended to punch through enemy armor. The civilian version of the bow is scaled down 75% in length and width to fit a smaller build plate (110mmx110mm) but maintains the full thickness of the original for strength. The loop for the arrows and the indentation for the bracer have been kept at their original size. Meaning the civilian bow is compatible with the original bracer. Bow has also been altered for a right hand draw. The set is perfect for a variety of bow wielding characters such as Merida, Katniss/Gale or the kids from Red Dawn (original).

0,15874,5mm Aegis Clip for Athena Makeover Kit,SummaryExtends the tab on the Aegis clip from 2mm to 5mm. Provides compatibility with a wider selection of arms of Barbie style dolls. The Athena Makeover Kit is designed for the Fashionista type dolls that have movable hands. The default 2mm clip does not work as well for the fixed flared hand position of other models which tend to pop the shield off. This extended clip allowed the shield to fit securely. The 5mm clip also fits the male Barbie style dolls with larger forearm dimensions. The issue with the clip may be more of a problem for printers that do not make a clean transition from the tab to the circular band. My tab was slightly wider at the base than the top. The 5mm tab compensates for this issue allowing the tab to attach deeper and more securely in the shield.

The question above challenges students to mentally convert a 2D outline into a 3D object. While a majority of students are able to intuitively answer this question, many students struggle especially in a high-stakes standardized testing environment. The Nets of a Cube - Geometry Manipulative Set allows students to explore the connection between a 2D outline and a real 3D objects. Students fold/unfold the manipulative between a flat object and a cube. Like an optical illusion, once the students makes the connection, they are able to 'see' the relationship. This math manipulative was designed based on the need of a high school geometry teacher to provide a tactile learning experience for exploring 3D figures., The set contains 6 nets, 3 of the nets form a cube and 3 of the nets do NOT form a cube. The set allows teachers to create physical problems sets in a variety of formats that emulate standardized test questions. Which of the following nets could be folded to form a cube?

(6 answer multiple choice - 3 correct answers) These foldable cubes can be used for a variety of lesson objectives including math vocabulary, properties of a platonic solid, measurement, calculation of area and volume and percent error calculations. A pdf of lesson ideas for the foldable nets of a cube is included in the downloads. Printability: Designed for a 0.2 mm layer height. Has been printed successfully by designer in PLA/ABS on multiple machines including a Makerbot Replicator 2X. Variation of design has been printed in the wild. See instructions for printing tips. Educational Value: Design is based directly on stated needs of geometry and elementary math teachers. Manipulative has seen classroom use with students and balances content area appropriateness with fun. Is easier for students to manipulate than paper based alternatives. Creativity: The print flat design explores the flexibility of the print material to create a moving hinges that is foldable and appeals to students. The designs were created in Tinkercad and show how very basic shapes can create more complex structures. Visit my blog at http://www.designmaketeach.com for more 3D printing lesson ideas. If you have any comments or suggestions, please feel free to leave them in the comments or contact me on Twitter @designmaketeach or Facebook https://www.facebook.com/DesignMakeTeach.InstructionsNets of a Cube are printed flat and then folded into shape. Only 3 of the designs can be folded into cubes (Netcubea.stl, netcubeb.stl and netcubec.stl). Can be printed with or without infill. Examples were printed with PLA. Designed for a 0.2 mm Layer height. Note for Printing on a Makerbot Replicator 2: The print must be oriented (rotated) on the build platform so the infill lines are as perpendicular as possible to the folds. If the infill lines are parallel to the folds the folds will crack. In an earlier version of Makerware the print could be rotated to the optimal 45 degree angle to create a hinges from the threads of plastic. New version of Makerware will cause the infill to run parallel to the folds at 45 degrees. We've had success rotating the print to approximately 30 degrees. Slic3r users have reported success with a concentric fill pattern. Design requires tape or glue to hold the shape of a cube. Original designs created by DesignMakeTeach.com in Tinkercad.

0,15886,Pumpkin Tooth Replacement Project,"SummaryEvery year millions of pumpkins around the world are the victims of tooth loss due to physical trauma, decay and improper 'carving'. The Pumpkin Tooth Replacement Project seeks to provide low cost 3D printed replacement teeth as a means of addressing this global problem. The purpose of this Thing is to serve as a prompt for a simulation of a global health initiative. Global change can be difficult to study/model in the time scale of a school year or the resource constraints of a classroom. Determining the causes and size of a problem, designing a solutions and implementing an action plan on a real health issue would be very difficult. The Pumpkin Tooth Replacement Project prompt provides a concrete scenario that allows students to collect authentic data, design working solutions and then implement the plan.

Styled to match traditional square shaped pumpkin teeth. The tooth can be scaled to meet the dimension of the pumpkin patient and 3D printed to create a customized and low cost replacement. The 3D printed tooth itself should prove to be durable enough to last for the entire life span of the pumpkin. The tooth as currently designed is not optimized and it is hoped that the 3D Printer community will develop superior alternatives that can be quickly implemented globally. **Warning: Care should be taken NOT to expose 3D printed parts to open flames.

The outer lip is wide enough to hold a few grapes/chocolates/nibbles and I've tested it with a full glass of.... well...

0,15908,Jakku Salvage Crawler,"Sized for the current Hasbro 3.75"" Star Wars action figures, this motorized vehicle assembles (and disassembles) with modular, magnetized parts and features a casing for LittleBits parts that make it run!
Built out of parts salvaged from defeated Rebel Alliance ships, scavengers on Jakku use vehicles such as this to collect scrap and defend their claim from rival scrappers.
This unofficial toy is an original design made in homage to the release of The Force Awakens and our entry into the LittleBits Bit-Wars challenge.The model was designed in TinkerCAD where you can find and hack it. If you make variants or more modular pieces, we want to see pics! This was a joint-project with my IGG co-founder, Jeremy Larsen.
We printed our parts at a .2 layer height with 15% infill. If your rig is primed (plate leveled and such) then the tolerance should allow the pieces to slid/snap together. Otherwise, feel free to shave, sand, whittle, and glue as needed! You'll need to glue the magnets in place. Painting isn't necessary (you could just print in the colors you like) but we used a sloppy drybrush technique using the biggest brush we could find. We used a combination of Games Workshop and P3 paints, though any acrylic miniature paints will work. The other materials you'll need (in addition to the printable parts) are as follows: 
3/4""/19.1mm Grommets x1
3D Printed ABS x1
3D Printed PLA x1
9.5mm Rare Earth Magnets x1
LittleBits Gizmos & Gadgets kit x1: http://littlebits.cc/kits/gizmos-and-gadgets-kit
We've set up a Patreon page for anyone who's interested to help fund us so we can keep making free and open sourced games like Pocket-Tactics, Wayfarer Tactics. and others, not to mention the growing catalog of toys and gaming miniatures that you can use for whatever you want! (Psst... we take requests and commissions...)

MobBob is a smart phone controlled robot. By harnessing the power of your smart phone, MobBob is a walking, talking robot with voice recognition and computer vision that you can build for around $30. I will be continuing to extend his features over time. I want MobBob to be a companion robot that everyone can afford and have fun with. You can see videos of MobBob V2 Remix in action here: https://youtu.be/aZaUMOi9q0k ..... Coming soon!! The main aims of the V2 remix were to: Support standard 9g servos [previously I was using Tower Pro SG90 servos] Make everything easier to assemble [no more need for glue] Make it easier to adapt/modify for other phones. The new bracket system made it easier to exchange a new phone / the battery holder. Also, in my V2 Remix build, I'm also using the Arduino Nano instead of the DIY Nano shield, so the entire build is smaller and tidier. :) MobBob V2 Remix uses the same software as the original MobBob V2.

I use foam sheet as the background which is soft enough to slide in without any tension. UPDATE: I have created a further centre support - with integral foamboard clip - that can be positioned anywhere between the two end stops, to give added support when a large background sheet is used.

0,15954,Foamboard clips,"SummaryA set of three variations of retaining clips designed to fit 5mm thick foamboard in model-making, by holding sections in position after applying glue (PVA) and waiting for it to set. They can also be used to hold the sections together without glue in order to check that everything is right in the model. The clips are very small and the walls are just 1mm thick and each is 10mm high. The retaining part in each that holds the foamboard is 15mm long. A combination of all three clips should cover all junctions in a model. UPDATE: I have added a spacer clip which is an open ended clip to fit along the length of two foamboard sheets. It is not strictly a corner junction, but is designed to hold long sheets together at any position along its length thus enabling fixing without gluing. Ideally it is suitable for open box constructions for exhibitions. It creates a gap of 1mm but this is barely noticeable. UPDATE: I have now added a small version of the centre spacer which becomes part of the three variation clips. It is possible to build a box from foamboard with a corner clip and a spacer_small clip, without any glue.

But as I access the contents frequently, I don't want to have to seal the box every time, to avoid the flaps from remaining open. So I have created this closure clip which slides in between the two longest flaps and holds the box closed without sealing it. The bigger or longer the box, the more clips can be used.InstructionsThe 4mm clip will accept up to 3,5mm thick card and the 7mm clip will accept up to 6.5mm thick card.

0,15956,NebHolder,"SummaryNebHolder: Many very young children on ventilator support use in-line nebulizer support. These nebulizers are not held to the face, instead are inlined through the ventilator tubing port. The Nebulizers unfortunately come with support for hand held/mask supply - which makes business sense since majority of the users are of that age group. However for infants who are scared already of all the medical equipment, a little bit of a distraction is useful. Further, trying to keep these nebulizers stable with a kicking and active child is even more hard. Hence.. the Nebulizer Holder :). This uses the Utils/Nutjob (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:193647) nut_6x9.stl embedded into the carraige and needs a washer and an additional nut_6x9.stl jack to hold things together. TBD: I wish i had changed the smokestack to be a little wider to fit in the tip of the neb tube when changing, but it can be stuck up in the carriage way as well. I also think this design can be modified with a small motor and AA battery holder in carraige way to give periodic shake to the neb cup to help the meds move along. This print also requires support (unfortunately for the open carraige...) i used 15% for support, 20% infill. Overall, please be careful NOT to pinch the tubing when Neb is pushed in.

This print should require zero support or raft, as I've included built-in supports for printing.  This is the second version of this file, updated with much better part tolerances than the first version.
The PDF file explains my print settings and gives a little bit of insights as to how everything goes together.
My print came out fairly decent... however, my slicing engine added a thin layer of material across the Y-axis dovetail joint on the main body.  I had to remove that material, then the carriage slid right into place.  The milling head fits just tight enough to remain in position wherever you want it, yet moves up and down quite nicely.

I don't know if printing in PLA or ABS will affect the print. The tolerances on the lid are very tight so minimal trimming may be necessary for the posts to fit into the sockets properly. If I could find them, I would take some material off the post and glue a couple of 10mm neodymium magnets in the sockets and on the ends of the posts to hold the lid and base together for a more secure closure.

I used taulman3d.com/t-glase-features.html ( https://www.lulzbot.com/store/filament/t-glase ) for the sphere -> NOTE: t-glase material is pretty strong - I was able to print the sphere without support or brim.

Supports and T-Glase is just plain hard to clear up (at least for me). So I just used minimal brim (in lulzbot) and no support for the sphere. Since I used HIPS, I used support just for the base (primarily the for the ""T"" in Thank you).",44889,Nishanth Menon

Needless to say it'll also stick to windows or other flat surfaces too.  You'll need to find four suction cups (you can get them, again, from places like Amazon or eBay for a very small sum) which you will need to push into the apertures on the mounting and for preference glue them in there too just to make sure.  I had to make this one in two separate parts because for some reason my printer wigged out when I tried to print it as one; you can glue the cup into the holder or you can just push it in (it's a tight fit, purposely), it's entirely up to you.

0,16062,Snow Plow Ice Scraper,"UPDATE: Now includes beefy 3/4"" threaded version, with poll extension and handle; also fits standard 3/4"" broom handles. Each extension adds about 170mm (6.7"") to the handle length. (Fits the broom handles I have around the house, I know there are other sizes in some areas.)
Most ice scrapers are the same. They do the job, but leave ice and snow all over your car. The SNOW PLOW 3D printed ice scraper is different. It's made so you can direct debris off your vehicle while you are cleaning the windshield. Working much like a full size snow plow, the blade scoops and directs loose snow and ice away from your vehicle. Unlike ordinary ice scrapers, the SNOW PLOW has two edges, a flat sharp edge for getting down to the glass, and a serrated edge for breaking up ice that works. Common sense and now laws, in the US, require drivers to fully remove ice and snow from their vehicles before heading out onto the road. Don't cause an accident or get a ticket...use the SNOW PLOW! 
Also a fun toy for kids to play with by plowing their own roads in the snow. 
The SNOW PLOW is designed to be 3D printed, with ribs for strength, and orientated not to delaminate, like typical 3D printed scrapers do. It prints strong without any support, so there's no waste. It prints fast and comes off the build plate ready to use. 
PRINTING 
It is important to use a fresh quality filament, since strength is important. 0.2mm 30% infill 5 perimeters. Tested in ABS, PLA and PET+ with these settings, resulting in a strong and usable tool.
NOTE: Threaded version required support.",17368,richard_swika

This helps create the most snug fit.",27006,Matthew Joseph Andrews
0,16075,Battery Charge Status Indicator,"This is a charge indicator that can be stuck onto any battery and can then be used to indicate whether the battery is charged or not. It works via a sliding mechanism that slides between two halves - one half indicates fully charged whilst the other half indicates empty. You'll notice in the photos that this indication was printed in three colours (green for full and red for empty) however, if you don't want to print yours in 3 colours then you can print it all in one colour because there is a cross and a tick in each half. 
The indicator is printed in 3 parts which means that it requires assembly. This is easy as all you have to do is insert the slider into one half and then glue the two parts side-by-side onto the battery so that the slider can move between the two halves. (if you glue the two halves directly together there is a chance you will glue the slider so it cannot slide). For adhesion you can use double sided tape or normal multipurpose glue. 
The indicator was printed using our own PLA filament. You can buy some here: http://www.3dexfilament.co.uk

0,16083,Chain v1 (looped and open versions),"I've included two versions of this model... one is a complete loop, and the other is open.  (Hint:  The only difference is that the ""open"" version is missing one link. )  None of the links touch each other, so the idea here is that--once removed from your build surface--you will have a true 3D-printed chain to secure your 3D-printed King Kong, monster, evil leprechaun, et cetera.  :) Each link of the chain is 2"" long and 1"" wide, with a 0.25"" diameter.  Each link is tilted at a 45° angle, so make sure your printer can perform that task... otherwise, add supports and have fun cleaning it up.  I haven't printed this model yet, since my printer is down for a while... but I'll post images if/when I'm able to print it. This is my first variation of this design, and it has not been tested.  Print at your own risk (of course).  In the future, I plan to add links to this model by using a spiral pattern instead of a simple circle.  I may even add a hook to one end, and perhaps a wall-mount on the other.  (Would make an interesting towel hanger for your bathroom... but your wife won't like it much, unless you print it in pink.)  :) The main image here shows the chain with alternating colors.  If you have a dual-color printer and would like to print it that way, simply ask and I'll add ""Color A"" and ""Color B"" STL files here.  
I may also add another version of this model with the links tilted at a lesser angle, if anyone has issues printing the links at 45°. At any rate, I hope you enjoy.  Please share any prints, comments, or suggestions. Thanks! ***UPDATE*** I was finally able to print this model, after repairing my DaVinci 1.0 Pro.  I did not use a raft or any supports, but should have used a raft due to the very small surface area that these chain links have to adhere themselves to the print bed.  I lost several links during the print, but still ended up with a length of chain that is about 21 inches long, and looks pretty nice. I printed this using black RioRand PLA at 200°/50°C with 0.25mm layers,  and15% infill.  Total print time was about 5h:10m.  Definitely use a raft, if you print this object... and by all means, please share photos of your print.   ",42442,clint_campbell

0,16094,Wayfarer Tactics Core Set (18mm scale),"Introducing the core set for our (years in the making) tabletop miniature wargame system, Wayfarer Tactics!

Wayfarer Tactics was recently successfully Kickstarted and, as promised, we've released the rules codex free and open sourced. You can download it here with the models or on our website. If you or someone you know is into tabletop miniature gaming, come check it out!
This set was designed for 18mm scale gaming, and includes special rulers (with 2-cm increments), though you can feel free to use inches or ceentimeters if you prefer. The factions included would also be easy enough to proxy with lots of 28mm miniatures that are available out there. For this core set, you'll need 6 red dice, 6 blue dice, a couple of white dice, two decks of playing cards, and you'll want to print: Sorceress x1, Hobgoblin Brute x4, Hobgoblin Archer x3, Goblin Wretch x7, Goblin Warlock x1, Freespace Merc Captain x1, Freespace Merc Technician x1, Freespace Merc Heavy Support x1, Freespace Merc Trooper x3, Spotter Drone x2, Trooper Casualty x1, Measuring Stick x2, Ruined Wall A x1, Ruined Wall B x1, Ruined Wall C x1, Ruined Wall D x1, Ruined Wall E x1, Well x1, Rubble Pile A x2, Rubble Pile B x2, and Ruined Wall Corner and Corner Upper Floor x4 each.
We've set up a Patreon page for anyone who's interested to help fund us so we can keep making free and open sourced games like Pocket-Tactics, Wayfarer Tactics. and others, not to mention the growing catalog of gaming miniatures that you can use for whatever you want!

0,16172,AG GoPro 3/4 Armour,"GoPro protection on multirotors has been something I've been experiementing on since breaking my first Hero3 on my miniquad. This lead me to make my youtube video on how to mod the stock housing, which was praised and used by FPV Pilots such as Metalldanny. https://youtu.be/KxhskpvpH8s
I decided to design a 3D printed version... The AG GoPro Armour features:
- lined inside with craft foam
- the width of the armour is the same as the gopro, so it can fit in gopro cages of existing miniquad frames (such as the MB Epic and Hovership Zuul
- the buttons are protected from being hit or pressed accidently
- a standard gopro lense protector can be used
NOTES:
- use an adhesive back craft foam to line the inside of the armour. Use this or something similiar http://www.michaels.com/creatology-value-pack-adh...
- the GoPro will fit inside the armour with friction from the foam. A velcro strap can be used to secure the armour onto the GoPro. Use this or something similiar http://www.michaels.com/velcro-brand-one-wrap-str...
- in some mounting scenarios, I don't use the velcro strap, because the gopro cage of your miniquad will have its own velcro strap to hold the GoPro (and armour) to the frame.
- on your miniquad gopro cage frame, use the same craft foam to line where it will make contact with the AG GoPro Armour. It will give it extra support, dampen vibration and keep the Armour from sliding.
- because the buttons are protected and recessed inside the AG GoPro Armour, use a stylus or other rounded pointing device to access and press the buttons.
- when cutting the foam, press the foam onto the Armour and cut along the indents
- a curved lexan scissor works well to cut curves in the foam
- a hole puncher works well to cut out circles in the foam

0,16182,Airwolf3D HD Series Printer Enclosure Panels,"SummaryHD Series Enclosure Panels. Shown on my HDx but will work on all models except the HDR, which is already enclosed. I wanted a way to keep heat inside the printer so that I get the best possible layer adhesion with ABS and other higher temp materials. Update 2/28/15: I have updated the mounts to add more strength. The old version cracked under the force of the magnets to the steel washers. I have also modified the knobs to make the top surface flat to make them easier to print. To install the left side panel you will have to remove the four screws holding the Viki in place. Move the Viki unit over without unplugging and slide the left panel into place and secure with the screw that holds the spool holder in place. I also found a slight mismatch with the front panel to the side panel mounts. The holes in the side panels need to be about 1/8"" higher. I have updated dxf file. If you downloaded before 3/1/15 then you need to update your file. Update 10/22/15: I have found that the hood can cause cause too much heat build up resulting in premature aging of the ABS parts in the build area. I had several of the belt mounts crack under the the normal load of the belts. Airwolf3D was generous enough to replace under warranty and I am back up and running again. I have since removed the hood and all seems well. Panels ordered from Pololu Laser Cutting www.pololu.com email: laser@pololu.com Contact: Arthur Rodriguez Cost $66 plus shipping for 3/16"" clear acrylic laser cut panels. InstructionsThe knobs will need to be tapped with #10-32 screw thread or you could add threaded inserts to the part. I added small screw holes in the panels but they are not really needed. You can remove them in the dxf if you like. The panels fit great and the printer looks sharp with the panels and hood in place. Enjoy!",51806,Kill-Switch

""Wee yet deadly accurate, the Dryads' engines are not easily dismissed."" —Qie Zi, The Art Of Seej Weeks of intense R&D at Zheng Labs have resulted in a passel of exhausted kobolds and the Stinger Micro Ballista. The Stinger's designed for printing on tiny 3D printers; the entire engine, nock included, will easily fit on a 128x128mm build platform. Best yet: it prints in two pieces instead of four, considerably reducing one's time-to-Seej. The nock's been completely redesigned to fix a firing problem that' has plagued previous ballistae. We've also included models designed to fit both U.S. and U.K. pennies. Message Lao Zheng with dimensions if you'd like a nock that accomodates your local coinage, and we'll have the kobolds flogged until they produce what you need.

The experiment...The largest nozzle is the same size as the hole in the funnel. This was done for consistency between tests. Use clean, dry sand. It's a good idea to run it through a screen to make sure there are no big pieces of anything in it. Hold a finger over the opening and pour in the sand. Use a straight edge to level off the top. Start a timer as you remove your finger and hold the funnel level and steady. Record the time to empty it. Do at least three trials at each nozzle size and average them. Make a plot of time in seconds against the nozzle diameters ( or areas). The diameters were chosen to give you a hole area of about: 1.0 in sq 0.75 in sq 0.50 in sq 0.25 in sq",17189,PRINTinZ

0,16263,Diamagnetic Levitation Using Bismuth and Magnets,"SummaryThis is the frame of a project that uses two bismuth plates and a large magnet to make another magnet levitate. Bismuth is number 83 on the periodic table and has many unique properties. It creates beautiful crystal formations and is diamagnetic. For this project we will use bismuth's diamagnetic property. Diamagnetic materials, like bismuth, when introduced to a magnetic field it creates a force that is the opposite of the magnetic force that has been presented to it. 1. This should only be done with parental guidance because this project can be dangerous at times. 2. Some of the stl files provided are different from the pictures shown, but they should be easier to use and better looking in the final product. 3. Better pictures will be uploaded sometime this week to show how to put it together/ how it worksPrint SettingsPrinter Brand: Up!Printer: Up MiniRafts: Doesn't MatterSupports: NoResolution: 0.3mm recommendedInfill: Any besides noneNotes: I recommend using a low resolution because the middle and top pieces will slide too much without the rough outside of the object.How I Designed ThisThis is my inspiration for my design and it uses the same principles that is shown in this video.RequirementsWhat You Need A pound of pure bismuth Two neodymium magnets 2a. One large to glue to the top piece. 2b. One small to put in between the bismuth plates to levitate Two soda cans- you need the bottom of them to mold the molten bismuth Steel pot- one you don't like anymore because it will probably be ruined when you melt the bismuth Stove Hot glue gun Super glue Instructions You will need to flip over your soda cans and i recommend having something beneath them like a steel pan in case of any spills of the molten bismuth. You will need to melt down your bismuth on a stove in your steel pot. Once melted slowly pour the molten bismuth onto the bottom of the soda cans and wait for them to cool When they're cooled down find a way to remove them from the bottom of the cans and sand the semi flat ends to make them even flatter; then you can polish it if you want. Next you will need to print all of the pieces provided and you can follow the pictures to see how they go together Then you can get your hot glue gun and glue the bismuth plates into the little indents provided and try to keep both of them as flat as possible, it's not a big deal if it's not exactly flat.

0,16475,1960's Sport Seat Bucket Seat (Cobrette),"This is a model of a classic 1960's Sports Car seat.
The seat has been scaled so the width of the seat is 1 mm.  This allows the purchaser to size the width of the seat to fit their particular model.  If you seat needs to be 35 mm wide then just scale it up by 35.
The original size of this seat was 565.15 mm (22.25"")  so, if you are printing a 1/8 scale model of this seat then you should just divide 565.15 by 8 and that will result in your scaling factor (70.64).  If you are printing a 1/12 scale model of this seat then just take 565.15 and divide by 12 and you get a scaling factor of 47.1

0,16478,"V.2 Flex Fingers, Swivel Thumb Prosthetic Hand","SummaryThis is the latest version of a work-in-progress prosthetic hand that incorporates flexible fingers, adaptive grip, flexible gauntlet, mesh palm and rotating thumb. The fingers, palm mesh and gauntlet are designed to be printed in flexible filament only. The filament used in the photos is TPU. You can size the fingers by scaling them before slicing. The photo shows a 125% gauntlet, a 120% palm with two 110% fingers, two 115% fingers, one 120% finger arranged in an approximation of an actual hand. The mesh palm is scaled the same percentage as the palm or can be printed larger for a bigger pocket.Print SettingsRafts: NoSupports: YesResolution: .3Infill: VariedNotes: The revised .stl files now utilize a ball joint attached finger/thumb. The fingers have been enlarged at the base, tapered to the tip and also incorporate a textured bottom for better gripping ability. Silicone ""tippies"" will also aid with grasping objects. The ovals are now mildly compressible to better conform to odd shapes. The thumb is made to swivel in its socket so that it can either oppose the palm or align somewhat parallel and still function according to user needs. The photo is outdated....
Palm is PLA with 30% infill printed at 200C with support touching the build plate. The fingers are printed on their side in TPU at 230C with 17% infill and support from the build plate. The gauntlet is printed on end with brim for stabiliity in TPU, 30% infill at 230C. The whipple tree, tensioner pins and wrist connectors are all printed in PLA. To eliminate ""angel hair"" from TPU ooze I used a heat gun. Flame also works but is neither as effective nor clean as the heat gun method.Post-PrintingAssemblyThe fingers print whole and snap into the palm with no further assembly except running a line from the fingertip through the palm to the whipple tree behind the palm. The whipple is then connected to the gauntlet. The thumb is a direct line from finger to gauntlet through the palm. Monofilament works best for actuation purposes. I used 50# monofilament for the fingers and 80# monfilament for the thumb. Also, I think that crimps work best for tying off the various lines. You can use either one line per two fingers (looping around one of the whipple sides for each pair, then the finger ends can be crimped) or individual lines crimped at the whipple. Fingertip crimps will fit inside the finger structure for safety. Care needs to be taken when adjusting the thumb in relation to the palm so that all fingers can fully close and re-open cleanly.How I Designed ThisCredit to:Vladimir for his Gauntlet and whipple designs and profbink for his ""Osprey Hand""",52720,1d1
0,16479,20x20 V Wheel Bracket for Magnetic Conversion,"SummaryConvert a standard 20x20 frame extrusion to a V Wheel, magnetic arm system at minimum expense. Spheres are 5/8"".InstructionsUsing standard 24mm V wheels on standard 20x20 extrusion can be done by printing one complete Carriage Set for each tower. The carriages are set for 5/8"" Spheres and utilize a belt drive. The photos show basic construction. The lower belt attachment is done with one 6mm wide spacer held by a small metal screw (1/2"" long) directly into the carriage. The upper mount uses the same screw size to a narrower spacer and goes to the belt with an adjustable tie wrap. The wheels are mounted with asymmetric spacers, the smaller one to the front or inside of the delta and the taller one to the rear. This allows the front carriage piece to ride on the 20x20 for extra stability (room for a piece of slippery tape for smooth travel) and will keep the rear rear carriage from hitting the 20x20 on the back side. Note: things fit tightly, but the carriage should move pretty freely once everything is assembled. You will need 5mm screws (or 10-24, US) and everything may need a touch of finesse for the best fit. I epoxied the spheres in place and put a dab of CA on the flags. Works perfectly so far....",52720,1d1

One super glued to the door, and the other hot glued into the holder. 1) Remove the center screw (2.5mm hex) from the front frame of the FFCP Printer. 2) Insert screw into holder and screw all the way down. Its supposed to be tight. 3) Screw the holder back into the printer, and position the holder facing downward, and tighten down the screw. 4) Using the holder to turn (do not use the screw), unscrew the holder. 5) Hot glue the magnet into the holder (keep the other magnet attached to this one) 6) Once cooled, again using the holder, screw it back into the printer. It should be nice and tight, facing downward. 7) Place a small drop of super glue on the other magnet and open the door and hold it against the magnet for a few minutes.Print SettingsPrinter: Flashforge Creator ProRafts: Doesn't MatterSupports: NoResolution: .1000Infill: 25%",41946,RJ_Make

0,16540,El nido del Aguila - Atlantida - Uruguay,"The city of ATLANTIDA was founded in 1911 but its population increased only since 1939 , when the Italian Natalio Michelizzi bought the total of the lands that were not yet urbanized and gradually founded the first hotels in the area. They were a time when Europe was the worst war and then both Montevideo and neighboring Buenos Aires investments were ideal for old world who wanted to flee the war.
The Eagle , as the locals call it , was originally a house , a favorite refuge of Natalio Michelizzi pioneering spa . His project was conducted by Juan Torres by artisanal means . The huge eyes are the windows of the living room , from which the open sea directly observed. It's easy to plunge into the peace of this place to contemplate the horizon through those eyes, away from the world , just listening to the murmur of the sea The solitary bird has spawned many myths and legends , some disturbing . It was said of a time that construction had been directed a A chapel. Also rumors that was for a time haunt of smugglers and hay who came to believe it was included a Nazi enclave UN A tail confusion due one Hitler had a house in the German Alps Also called Eagle's Nest.
This is an excerpt from an interview with Juan Torres who made the place by order of Natallio Michelizzi : ""Mr Juan ... What is really El Aguila (the eagle)?"" - I was just a fleeting impression or flashed his eyes almost blind with new life?
- ""¿El Aguila ... It's nothing like what you imagine or what people think."" - Replied, with the abruptness of the doctor who made the diagnosis of an incurable disease or wise, sick of hearing a thousand times the same stupid question from a student stupid.-
- ""And what is it?""
- ""A whim ... nothing more than a whim of a very special man ... a simple idea that was transformed into a chimera ... only that Michelizzi Natalio, who was practically the inventor of this resort, me. he asked to be built in the bottom of the garden of his house called ""El Barranco"" which bordered on the beach- a niche two meters by two, to place there a Madonna thought bring Buenos Aires and never came ... a niche ... a box ... a kind of chapel ... a place, as he said ""for women wanting to lay flowers and light candles are removed"" .-
After that Juan makes a living waters 4 to 4 meters by 4 and Natalio returning from Buenos Aires where his family was met with prompt room, he liked it and asked me to open an archway at the side and add a bedroom ... I did as requested ... I was then figured it was a good place for friends and wanted a kitchenette and a bathroom ... They are also made. When the building was soon looking a long time was silent. Then he said: - ""How about, Torres, now if you make me an eagle on top?"" - ""One that?"" I replied - ""An eagle ... and covered with stones to look like feathers."" And he left. In a company that had more sculpture than architecture, I built on the hipped roof a sort of wooden mold shaped like the head of an eagle, so I lined inside with stone, I unfolded the iron and I poured the concrete. I left that will set and, by removing wood there was the eagle! "" At that time the expression of Juan Torres was of great happiness. He seemed to be looking at a vision that youth returned within himself and energy.-
:::I went This place several times when i was a child it´s only about 70km from the place I live. I was always curious. By the way , the fact that it is old , it is you rebuild , that is stone , which is an eagle , who could have done and how?
Today bigger and perhaps understanding all this. And with the possibility of having a machine that prints the way I say. I pay tribute to this Natalio who believed in the impossible and John the one that doit majestically . ( I also call me Juan hehe) . I did not understand very well if you have to say where would like to visit and that is the price or if the prize is a trip to this place. I would Travel to anywhere that has a similar mystique and appears as a model in this contest.

Put the top adjuster part aside, you won't need it anymore. The assembly is composed of 3 layers, 2 of them are composed of thick aluminium plate, one goes under the platform and the other one on top of it. Insert your extruder in a hole and guide your wires in the wire socket clockwise to it. Insert the 3 thin aluminium batman style plates to hold the extruder head in place. It should lock it in place. Put back the screw opposite to your extruder head, screw head up and nut uder the assembly, tight it, you won't have access to it later. Install the motor assembly on top of the plate. Make sure your bowden tube goes into the guide hole of the motor support (I used a filament to guide the bowden tube). Using the 2 remaining platform screw and their nuts, screw the motor support in place. Put the screw head down and the nut over the support. Using the 2 extras screw in the Ezstruder package, secure the 2 arms of the motor support, theses will help with stability.

0,16640,LED Ornament Topper,"SummaryThis is the LED ornament topper that was a collaboration between CCCKC Hackerspace and Hammerspace Hobby & Community Toolshop (our new home) in Kansas City. It is a fun, quick 4 soldering point ornament insert. The LED cycles between several colors and modes with each on and off cycle. We decided to keep it awesome by printing the body and using only two components (LED and battery holder) and copper wire to extend the leads to create the ornament hanger and integrated switch! We created this holiday-themed project as a fun way to create a gift and learn to solder at the same time! We hope you enjoy it and please customize it! It is a blank canvas and ripe to become many different characters and uses. One thought is to NOT trim one of the copper leads and have two swirls at the top, tapping those together to become a switch. Slap some googly eyes and BAM, reindeer! And don't forget Hanukkah! Turn these upside down and make a Menorah with 9 prints. You get the idea. Let those derivatives fly and feel free to improve it!

Use hot glue or double stick tape. *Extend outer leads with stiff wire. Use too much and trim later. Use JUST enough solder or you won't be able to fish it through the body. *Insert LED with extended leads into holes in end. Slightly bend middle (+) lead to assist fishing it through the middle hole. *The right-angle lead (-) gets soldered to the battery clip tab. The middle (+) lead gets soldered to the (+). *The downward pointing 45 degree angel lead (switch) gets shorted to (-) to turn the LED on, off, then on again to start the next mode. It's up to your creativity on how to bend or extend the leads out of the top, have fun. *Use any glass ornament, frosted or clear. *Remove clip and attach to nub on insert. It should snap but don't worry if it doesn't. Squeezing it together holds it on the nub as you insert the entire completed insert into the ornament. *Remove decorative cap and used over-sized tool to cut a whole for the insert, leaving a small lip to reuse as a decorative element. *Replace decorative cap. Insert completed ornament topper. *Rejoice in your awesomeness OR Give the print and the components as a gift and give the world another Maker!

So here is my simple solution the bed can be adusted at 4 corners and if necessary middles too by use of top and bottom m8 nut and bolt.

0,16653,2020 CNC 10mm Linear,"SummaryHaving built a Mostly Printed CNC which is a great design and machine I am hooked. As I regularly have time between software compilation and testing I am designing my own CNC first rough sketch in Tinkercad pictured. Inspired by MP_CNC but designed from scratch in Tinkercad. Ability to switch easily between CNC, 3D Print, and Laser Cutting/Engraving heads is the plan. Aim is to build a solid machine with doubled up linear supports (Easy to modify for additional strength and rigidity for larger builds) Using 10mm Linear shafts/bearings to keep accuracy and adding additional support bearings running on top of 2020 or similar to prevent sagging and aid accuracy. I am designing and building machine from the inside out one axis at a time Z then Y then X. Cost wise it will be slightly more expensive to construct than Mostly Printed CNC to build but although component wise almost identical, it should not be excessive if you find good suppliers of 2020 extrusion etc no reason 2020 could not be not replaced with 20x20 steel box section or even 20x20 Hardwood if these are more readily available to you only change will be fixings as I shall use mainly T-Nuts. I already spaced 2020 as a T Slot base for my MP_CNC which has been successful and initially I shall use same bed for this build. My plan is to release each Axis after it has been assembled and tested both STL and Tinkercad files. Z axis release due end of January 2016, complete machine by end of March 2016 as I am soon traveling for a few weeks therefore time for printing and testing will be limited for a while. ============== First printed part first change although it printed well it failed the strength test, forgot an important rule ""design for printing, not just for function"", the direction the plastic is laid down is as important as where it is laid down. Third time lucky as first design was rejected without going to printer, size and mass convinced me it would be too difficult to print without warping. ZY_Carrier(1).stl ZY_Carrier(2).stl ZY_Carrier(3).stl Main Z axis carrier combined with Y axis Bearings. Print with 4x top/bottom/Shell 0.25mm @ 60% fill. Supports are advised. Desription: Mounts the Z axis assembly sides onto the Y axis Linear Rods and Extrusions. Additional hardware used: 4x LM10 Linear Bearings 4x 608z Bearings 4x M8x35mm with NyLock Nuts (608z retention) 18x M4x8mm with T_nuts (2020 extrusion attachment) 8x M3x35mm with Nuts (LM10 retention) 2x 14mm 2020 aluminum profile (Horizontal frame) 2x 180mm 2020 aluminum profile (Vertical Frame) 2x 500mm Linear shaft (Y Axis Shafts) 2x 500mm 2020 (Y Axis 2nd carrier strength/support) 7 Jan 2016 Back from travels rested and ready for work and play started printing and testing Z Carriage today rough up picture loaded. Assembled and uploaded first part of Z axis carriage Top Bottom and Spacer, you will notice my Z axis is short I have other machines for depth on Z axis adjusting the length of your Linear Shafts and Lead Screw will allow you extra height on Z axis legs will also need adjusting accordingly later in the build. 8 Jan 2016 Time tight today so designed and started to print X axis carriages, when two parts printed I can see if my sums add up or if 2+2=3.78 as usual! 9 Jan 2016 Not quite 3.78 but after checking first print decided to add an adjuster under 2020 X beams as design requires accurate placement. 10 Jan 2016 Not a lot of time today but designed back plate for Z-axis have some other items currently hogging printers so will be tomorrow before I print and test the axis, other hardware should arrive this week to assemble properly using some long bolts to dry fit at moment. 11 Jan 2016 Another busy day but had a thought and knocked together a part also useful for MostlyPrintedCNC, a bed leveling leg usinga pair of m8 nuts and bolts a bed can be leveled by adjusting the 4 corners rather than the legs. 17 jan 2016 A dose of the FLU has had me laid up for a few days so l have not been documenting all changes for a few days , but have done some complete reworks on several parts, now have a mostly free standing unit ready for mounting drives and motors. Progess is well ahead of schedule will update documentation this week as hardware needed to complete assembly arrives one or two cable ties utilised whilst waiting. Experimenting using 10mm of 22mm heatshrink tubing to tyre the 608z bearings appears to be good but need to test durability when testing Amended the X_axis Carriers now printed as one piece and V slotted on bottom of print to prevent any one else from cracking a glass when removing from bed, 18/01/16 Z Axis reworked minor changes",54424,Lou

0,16656,Mostly Printed CNC QR Toolmount,"SummaryIdea was to put this out as an idea but now machine running it appears to be very useable and stable not added latching mechanism yet but simple hole and peg would accomplish this waiting on delivery of Router/milling head which is largest tool to settle on location of Latch and orientation. Ran into my first problem today and although I did not realise it a very slight descrepancy between my X and Y axis on Duo 2.0a, advice for others is print all plates in same direction as receiver to avoid tolerances on this extremely tight to avoid SLOP that may cause poor quality output. Added a mount for Silverline 600w Multipurpose Router still no latch but cut some old 4mm Hardboard as is with 3mm end mill cutter without any problem a little tougher than the foam test but no problems at moment if needed an elastic band under and over mount is the security latch when used a few times and loosens with wear latch will be needed so thats next. My design for a Quick Release head for the Mostly Printed CNC IE version using 25mm conduit, not ready for use yet as I am testing but more of an idea for someone to produce something that could be standard making tool heads easy to design and share. Any comments welcomed if you use it and it works would be nice to know, if you try it and it has a problem let me know and I will try to fix it. Needs a locking mechanism and tool holder to be of use basically a prototype to illustrate an idea. Printed and tried for size and fit of tool plate works nicely for IE version of Mostly Printed CNC using 25mm tubes. Next step add a latch and a tool holder then print a little slower looks like I pushed the i3 a little to fast this time. No play in the slide mount but clearance for the mounting screws will be a problem as it is so will need to add a small countersink. Tool mounts added for Flexible shaft 22mm and 21mm plus E3D V6 print head Cheap chinese copy, Silverline Depth guage for calibration, for testing purposes while still waiting on delivery of Silverstorm 600W 240V 1/4"" Multipurpose Router.

0,16657,Free Filament here's how!,"SummaryWith most of us throwing away PET in the form of Plastic Bottles it could be simple to use them in your printer. Unfortunately I do not have enough hours in the day but one or more of you may like to try this out. Its a concept an idea that would solve the problems of irregularities caused when using flaked or shredded PET through an Auger setup caused by irregularities of size air gaps and speed of feed, this method converting flat or square input to round is theoretically simpler. Step one: Turn the bottle into PET string as demonstrated by this guy. http://sploid.gizmodo.com/genius-guy-transforms-plastic-bottles-into-super-streng-1593598551 Instructions here: http://wonderfulengineering.com/heres-how-you-can-make-a-strong-wire-or-rope-out-of-your-used-plastic-bottles/ A printed version lifted from the comments thanks faggahz, I am sure most of this project exists in one form or another if it can be put together. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:480279 http://www.utsumi.com.br/pet/English/filetador/index.html Step two: A print head that can be fed by flat string extruding filament in 1.75 or 3mm format, it should be easy enough to overlap short sections to produce continuous filament. Also feeding in short lengths of filament left on reels to prevent waste or create multi color filament would be possible using same method. Step three: Link step one and two so that the motor feeding the extruder provides the power to strip the bottles a little work preparing and loading the bottles one after the other but free filament and recycling at its best.

Now up and running will be posting any improvements I make as I tune and adjust performance. I have made printer somewhat larger and intending a 300x300x400 print area up to 500mm height if possible. The printer is fairly large internal frame dimensions are 360x500 external dimensions with protrusions about 500x600mm height will be approx 600mm. Still checking all calculations and printing last pieces of main frame. Will keep updated as I go but if you begin printing before I have frame assembled, you may end up printing some parts twice. One or two edges may lack the refinement of original but thats down to the limitations of my knowledge and my use of TinkerCAD to do the conversion. As for my choice of color, I had a couple of KG of PLA sitting around with no plans, so loaded purple into my Wanhao i3 and Tangerine into my XYZ Da Vinci 2.0a may have been tri colored if I had built up the Delta I have sitting in a box to build while I wait for last few parts for this project to arrive from China.

This is a loot chest from Borderlands. I made it small because I didn't have a lot of desk space and I just wanted to store some SD cards in it. It could be scaled up if you wanted to though. Everything should work just find at bigger sizes. I wouldn't scale down very much though.
I printed this on my Robo 3D using PLA. It was printed 0.1mm layer height to capture all the details. I used a little bit of support on the lid, mostly for the handle. And a little on the body for the connectors on the back. I also used a raft to fight warping but I think this was overkill so I don't recommend using a raft. Infill doesn't matter much here but I went with 20% I believe.
As far as painting it, my wife primed it with white spray primer. Then she used water-based acrylic paints and brushes to paint all the details on it. Then after it dried she sprayed some gloss coating on it to give it a minimal glossy effect.

The Skin fold caliper is a device which measures the thickness of a fold of your skin with its underlying layer of fat. By doing this at the key locations can be a quite accurate representative of the total amount of fat that is on your body, it is also possible to estimate the total percent of body fat on your body.

This a replica clip for the front whiskers on the 1982 to 1986 Toyota Celica Supra's. This clip is not an exact replica in that it does not have the mold markings that the original clips have.
As items for the Celica Supra's become harder and harder to find items even as simple as clips will need to be re-produced to keep these amazing cars on the road and looking sharp!
I have printed out test prints of this clip in PLA although something like ABS or similar will be needed. I also have done the test prints in a .5mm nozzle although I believe a smaller nozzle will be important to print properly.
In order to greatly increase clip strength, be sure to print the clip on its side, 90° off from the way you see it in the photos.

0,16700,1950's Sports Car Bucket Seat (Stirling),"This is TDR Innovations 1950's sport seat.  This is the classic sports car seat of the late 1950's and would look perfect in any hotrod or sports car from that time era.
The seat has been scaled so the width of the seat is 1 mm. This allows the purchaser to size the width of the seat to fit their particular model. If you seat needs to be 37.3 mm wide then just scale it up by 37.3
The original size of this seat was 600 mm (23.6"") so, if you are printing a 1/8 scale model of this seat then you should just divide 600 by 8 and that will result in your scaling factor (75). If you are printing a 1/12 scale model of this seat then just take 600 and divide by 12 and you get a scaling factor of 50

0,16704,Wanhao Duplicator i3 Z-Axis Alignment Posts,"SummaryNOTE: This one works just fine but I recommend checking out my other version http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1241496 It has a customizer so you can tweak the size just how you want it as well as other nifty tweaks. This is by no means a mind blowing item but it was handy for me so I'm sharing. I'm also not a guru when it comes to printers so keep that in mind and use at your own risk. This is to help you align your Z-Axis in case it ever goes wonky or you just want to double check it. You should print 2 of these. A Note Before You Begin: If you twist one side of the Z-Axis and the other one doesn't move at all, you may want to consider following Jetguy's fix for that https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaroNfMVE4M I did it and now when I rotate one side, the other side moves along with it and my Z-Axis very rarely gets out of alignment anymore and when it does it is very minor. Guide: Raise your Z-Axis high enough that you can fit the posts between the frame and the X-Axis bars. Turn off the stepper motors. (This is important) Place the posts on the far left and far right side with the square part on the frame and the curved part under the X-Axis bar. Hand twist the Z-Axis until the X-Axis bar is resting on the posts on either side. (If you haven't done the Jetguy fix mentioned above, make sure if you have to do a lot of twisting that you don't twist one too far without twisting the other. Try to keep them level while you are doing it.) Slide the posts off of the frame parallel to the bar so you don't accidentally bump one side up or down. Celebrate because your Z-Axis is aligned. Print SettingsPrinter: Wanhao Duplicator i3Rafts: Doesn't MatterSupports: Doesn't MatterNotes: None of the settings really matter but I would like to point out, however, that you should print these at the same point along the X-Axis so they are in line with the Y-Axis. The reason is, if they were along the X-Axis and the Z-Axis is askew, one may end up taller than the other and you'd still end up with an alignment problem when you used them to help align the Z-Axis. If they are in line with the Y-Axis the worst that would happen is one side of both of them would be slightly askew but they would be identical in the most important ways.",55089,Zolan

0,16706,PebbleTime Dock,"SummaryNot happy with the short design, I decided to make this dock that is taller and displays the Pebble time nicely. The dock is simple yet functional, the USB cable fits perfectly in the dock, the cable is incorporated in the design and comes out the back nicely. The PebbleTime can sit securely on the dock even without the charging cable in case you just use it as a display dock. Hope you like it. **If you don't have a 3D printer look this dock up in Etsy.InstructionsJust print with supports, they are minimal so there will not be much wasted material. PLA is fine with 2 shells and 10% infil, its pretty sturdy and prints in around 2 1/2 hours. (Replicator2) I tried printing with Laywood but the material was too soft even at 50% infill, I had to add a bent metal wire to help support (guess my Laywood was more flexible than I thought) Hope you like it and let me know if it works out for you.

0,16711,GoPro Selfie handle,"SummaryMy friend got the GoPro 3-way and I thought I could just have some fun and design a similar one. First design looks good but I still need to add bolt holders and resize the joints. Also after the print it seemed a bit flimsy so I will make the walls a bit thicker. Hope it turns out great once I'm done. Update V2 I re made the whole thing from scratch and it turned out better, still have some little things to tweak but this V2 works already. I decided to get rid of the screw base and went for a simpler approach for now, I will probably add the mini tripod later. I unfortunately broke it while testing the strength of the joints so pictures don't show me holding it, but it felt solid. The handle has two holes as the higher one is the one that works directly with the GoPro housings. I will probably redesign it again from scratch with a more streamline design. Hope you guys like this version.InstructionsAugust 6, 2014 Re-disign looks good, printable and works great. Probably use good infill for rigidity and I suggest supports. It uses the same nut and bolt size as the regular go pro but you will need longer ones for two joints as they are thicker to accommodate the sturdiness of the modular handle. August 2, 2014 - Well, Do not print yet unless you want to make custom housing for the GoPro as I didn't make sure of the size of the outer diameter of the end joints. They all snap together just fine, just don't fit any GoPro accessories, so I have to resize a little. I am glad that everything snapped and worked but the designs still need some work. they are a bit messy and not optimized. Feel free to mod them if you want, or hopefully you do a better design. I will post the updates when I have a chance to fix them, also will make the walls a bit thicker as they are a bit flimsy at the moment.

We will post the final plans and files along with a list of do's and don'ts once we are making super cool armor and injection molds for weapons. We have a few designs we have been working on. One included the vacuum inside of the vacuum cavity. For that, we had the original Switch Housing. For that, we expected the wires to pass through the body of the former. We have decided to keep the vac outside of the former (So we can upgrade as we go) so we created the Ext Switch Housing 2 file. We also have some pretty simple feet, but our former is going to be 4' long, so we may add a secondary (middle) foot design to make sure it stays level.

0,16760,Utensil hooks,SummaryI have a thin cupboard by my kitchen sink that was a waste of space. I moved the seldom used or misshapen utensils from the utensil drawer to make a little space and become more organized in the kitchen. This design requires the hole in the handle to be oblong as most of my utensils are. It is affixed to the cupboard using the 3m double sided tape that comes off easily. Enjoy.,55686,ICanMakingThings
0,16761,Bungee Clips for tarps (Modified),"SummaryNot sure if it is kosher to remix your own thing, but here it is. I was asked to put this in a remix because it is pretty different from the original. The holes for the disco ball tether were enlarged on the clip and disco ball. a 3mm diameter string will work fine. I recommend about 2ft of tether to allow you to go around about a foot of tarp and still reach. The tether can then be stored wrapped around the clip with the disco ball inserted in the key hole. I'll get a pic up of it in the stowed position shortly. Enjoy.Print SettingsPrinter: Flashforge CreatorRafts: Doesn't MatterSupports: No",55686,ICanMakingThings

0,16768,Christmas Tree Tightening Bit,"SummaryOK, Putting up the Christmas Tree can be a pain in the phalanges. This little widget is sort of a Christmas tree stand drill bit. Just attach it to a drill as you would a bit or screw driver attachment, then place it on the bent post that tightens the tree into the stand. It works pretty slick to tighten the tree and get it where you want it. I leveled it myself and had my wife standing by to tell me if I had it level. Luckily for me, I only put one Christmas tree up every year. My stand has 5mm threaded rods. For those of you who are richer \ Insaner than me, and put up more than one tree or a have huge freakin' tree, feel free to hack this up and make it fit whatever you have in your living room\ ball room \gazebo\ guest house\ padded room.

0,16769,2016 time capsule,"SummaryI know, everyone is all hyped up on Christmas right now, but the New Year is upon us. This little capsule is just big enough for a tiny USB thumb drive , a note, and a trinket. The hard part is getting those things in there. The 'flat' version allows for you more room to plop the items in there under the extruded (just pause the print for a second), but depending on your machine, I added the tall version as well. The little slit near the end is to show where to cut it open with a saw (or something). The thumb drive could have Photos, Text Files, scans of your kids' recent art work, passwords to online resources for an online time capsule, any number of creative things. Happy New Year",55686,ICanMakingThings
0,16770,Bungee Clips for tarps,"SummaryI have a great little trailer that I use to haul everything. The problem is that the eyelets on the tarps don't line up with the tie-downs on the trailer to allow the tarp to pull tight and/or straight. Here is the solution I came up with: The small hole is the bungee hook hole. The 'disco ball' gets wrapped in the tarp, then pushed through the large hole and pulled through far. The tarp is then slid along the keyhole section and pulled tight, the disco ball then disallows the tarp from pulling through and allows you to attach the bungee at any point on the tarp. If you put the disco ball on the inside of the tarp. it allows the bungee to also hold the tarp ends down a little thereby reducing some of the flapping in the wind. This is not designed to be used on the same spot on the trap over and over. If you have the tarp on the trailer or load for a long time, make sure you check the wear on the tarp and/or move locations on the tarp to make sure you don't rip through. (The hole in the disco ball is to allow you to tie it to a location on the trailer so you know where it is at any time.) I'll have pics of how I have mine set up soon.Post-PrintingAdded a few pics of the printed clips. (I like the word clips) I hope they are enough to let you know how this works. I just realized that the bungee hook hole is too small for the new plastic bungee hooks. I'll get a new version up this evening.4 clips with enlarged bungee holes and lanyard holes.These are the updated versions I said I'd make weeks ago. The holes for the bungees are much larger to work with the newer plastic bungees, and there are holes to allow you to tether the disco balls to the actual clip so they stay with each other in storage. I'd recommend a lanyard about 2' long to allow them to be clipped a foot in from the tarp's edge if you need. Updated againThis version has the larger bungee hole but also has tapered sides to allow the lanyard to wrap around for when it is in storage. Will post pics when I print them.",55686,ICanMakingThings
0,16771,Stovetop Hot Lid Holder,"SummaryI love to cook, but when all of the burners are full, those hot lids or cooking spoons never seem to have a safe place to go, and placing them on the counter either makes a mess or drips the hot water from the lid all over. This is my response to that problem. The print is simple, and once you have it, get a large piece of double sided tape and simply stick it to the back of your stove. It is designed to hold a lid with a spoon across the top, or just a spoon sticking out the front. I find it cleaner for the spoon to hang over the pan rather than putting it on a spoon holder next to the stove. (Just one more thing to wash) I have 2 on my stove and use them all the time now.",55686,ICanMakingThings

0,16812,Automatic Cooling for Wanhoe Duplicator 4,"I’ve been testing this automatic fan upgrade for my Duplicator 4 and WOW what an improvement in the quality of life around here. Finally I can just start a print on my Dup 4 and walk away knowing the active cooling fan will start on its own. No more being a slave to the printer. It goes in series with my existing fan circuit and bolts on using hardware already there. It is micro adjustable so you can set it to turn on after a set distance into the print, up to about 5mm or even more if you use a longer M3 bolt in the adjustment mechanism. The fan always turns on at exactly the same distance into the print, not like when I had to do it by hand. I’ve been giving the printer a real workout lately printing inventory for my web store. I think my prints are coming out better than ever, with consistent results. There’s a manual override switch just in case I do need to go back to full manual control.
I always wanted to control my active cooling fan from gcode, but that requires soldering a surface mount MosFET (Q6) on to the Duplicator 4’s MightyBoard. I’m pretty good at soldering, but Q6 is a surface mount part and without the proper equipment I wouldn’t take the chance or damaging my MightyBoard and voiding my warranty. That would suck to put it mildly. These boards are in short supply and I can't risk being down. Plus I almost always just turn my active cooling on full after the first layer. I have gcode control on my i3 but never do more than 100% fan after the first layer. That could be done with a micro switch and 3D printed mount. I could use an external wall wart power supply and be totally isolated from my printer’s electrical system.

0,16853,3D Printable Dragon Puzzle,"This design is not new. It 'has been around'  on Thingiverse for a while. It's there in all sorts of formats (mostly suitable for lasercutting). But until now it wasn't available in 3D printable format. Since I've wanted to print this for a while I've been searching and waiting, hoping to find an printable version. No luck so far!
Therefore I spend some time (quite some time actually) to change the file to an .STL 3D printable format myself.
I had to scale it down to 80% and regroup the parts. The size of the thing is still impressive as you can see on the photographs. All the plates now fit any average printer bed. If your printer bed allows it, you could scale it back up if you like. 
The thickness of the parts are 1.8 mm., so it will print in 0.2 and 0.3 mm layers.  
I've printed this dragon puzzle using Form Futura' s see through HD-glass filament. This PET type material works nicely with a puzzle since it's strong but still a little flexible. Off course you can also use  ABS or PLA. Before you start: be warned! There are over 100 pieces!
This is where you can find one of the originals: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2700",27426,els_meulendijks
0,16854,Dice Set,"This is a standard set of dice as is frequently used for table top role playing games. I included both the whole dice models as well as a set split in half. The bottom side of a whole die model will not print as nicely in many printers, because of how the first layer is printed. This can be avoided using the halved models, because the first layer will be buried inside once the model is fully assembled.
I think they turned out nicely. The numbers are painted with a simple black acrylic paint, which I applied into the recessed numbers using a toothpick. The apparent difference in the color between each die is due solely to the reflective nature of the filament I used and the angle of the sides relative to the camera. They were all printed using the same silver filament. The symbol found on each of the dice takes place of the highest number on it, twenty sided die it's twenty etc. 
Update: The original model for the four sided die ended up having numbers that were far too small, at least for my printer, so I have added an updated version that works better. I decided to try the full model of the new version of the four sided die and it worked much better. The bottom didn't look as nice, so I wouldn't recommend using the un-split model. It is also important to keep in mind that if your extruder nozzle is too hot, sharp peaks on top can start melting and deform if it doesn't move away often enough to allow for complete cooling. This is another problem that could come from printing the whole dice models, especially the four sided die.
Recommended Settings:
Layer height: 0.1 mm
Infill: Maximum or nearly there (Low infill settings make the dice too light to roll nicely)
Supports: Not for the half dice (recommended), but many of the whole dice may need it.
Raft: Shouldn't need it, but do it if it seems like your printer will need it.",47797,quadfrog

0,16864,3D Printed Chalkboard/Whiteboard (Woodfill Borders),"Please watch this video for more details and to see how I did this: https://youtu.be/FfepDrXhgJA
This is a 3D printed chalkboard or whiteboard (depending on how you paint it). I just created a little plastic base, sanded it, painted one with chalkboard paint and the other with dry erase paint, and then attached the borders using some glue. I printed the borders out of Colorfabb Woodfill, but you could use any material you want. Then you can draw away!
There's also a speech bubble that you can make into a whiteboard or a chalkboard. The backs are flat as well, so attaching a magnet would be really easy. That way you can put it on your refrigerator.
Here is the list of materials you'll need to do this: Sandpaper (100-400 grit) Paint Primer Glue: http://www.amazon.com/15g-Gorilla-Super-Glue-Gel/dp/B00CJ5EO2E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1453931282&sr=8-1&keywords=15g+gorilla+super+glue+gel Chalkboard Paint: http://www.amazon.com/Krylon-Chalkboard-Aerosol-Spray-12-Ounce/dp/B00OY0NUL8/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1453931167&sr=8-3&keywords=krylon+chalkboard Whiteboard Paint: http://www.amazon.com/Diversified-Brands-KRY3940-Krylon-Erase%252c/dp/B010BTZJJG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1453931243&sr=8-1&keywords=krylon+whiteboard

Notes: These are really pretty simple prints and there's not any details on the sides, so layer height doesn't matter too much. Infill isn't that important either, because you probably won't need your chalkboard to be super strong.",31002,ChaosCoreTech

The OBJ file has been modified to be able to run ""tendons"" through model, as well as attach other designs (arduino / servos) to the model via the bolt holes. This is a work in progress, more files will be added. Some may be taken off / edited as the design improves. 
Highest success rate is with PLA around 200-210C, using a raft, and supports to ensure the bolt holes form correctly.

The filament wicks the ink along with it and dries before it gets to the extruder. (I printed some little struts to hold the pad in place on my Prusa.)

I followed the Boosted board design with the wires running under the grip tape.

Post-PrintingSealing and fasteningNot pictured: Weather stripping will be applied to the board in the shape of each case. Wood screws will fasten each case down and press the edge of each case into the weather stripping to form a watertight seal. Each case's bottom is curved to a radius of 17.25"" to match the curvature of the board (I've tested this on two types, and it seems to match both well). Electrical connectionA hole is drilled under each enclosure, and a channel made using a router. 10AWG wire connects the battery case to the VESC case. Power is connected using a simple shorting jumper to connectors on the outside of the battery case. Charging is done using a high-current hobby lipo charger and an externally exposed balance connector.How I Designed ThisTranslucent view to reveal VESC configuration inside.The two halves of the battery enclosure shown as assembled.",58087,Darren Odom

Two files: One with a stand, one without a stand. (Pictured printed with ABS without stand)
The Kinks were an English rock band formed in Muswell Hill, North London, in 1963 by brothers Dave and Ray Davies. They are regarded as one of the most important and influential rock groups of the era.[1][2] The band emerged in 1964 during the height of British rhythm and blues and Merseybeat, and were briefly part of the British Invasion of the US until their touring ban in 1965. Their third single, the Ray Davies penned ""You Really Got Me"",[2][3] became an international hit, topping the charts in the United Kingdom and reaching the Top 10 in the United States.[4] Between the mid-1960s and early 1970s, the group released a string of hit singles; studio albums drew good reviews but sold less than compilations of their singles. They gained a reputation for reflecting English culture and lifestyle, fuelled by Ray Davies' observational writing style.[2] Albums such as Face to Face, Something Else, The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society, Arthur, Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround and Muswell Hillbillies, along with their accompanying singles, are considered among the most influential recordings of the period.[1][3][5]

I also made them in a single file rather than as separate parts so it was easier to share. Now go out there and get those troops into shape!Post-PrintingThis is my print - after cleaning all the support material off. and here they are assembled...

0,17162,Life Size Thor's Hammer (Mjolnir),"Please watch this video for more information and to see it in action: https://youtu.be/D6DdESIhi4c
Welcome all who are worthy! (Okay I promise that's the only worthy joke I'll make here. There's more in the video though.) :)
This is a fully 3D printed Mjolnir. I made it life size. I'm sure it's not the exact dimensions of the movie prop but it's close. It can also be scaled pretty easily. This version of Thor's Hammer is specifically from The Dark World movie. I'll provide the steps for post processing in a lot of detail below, but if you want a higher level look at it, watch the video. I provided two different options for the main part of the hammer. It prints in 2 sections, and they are identical so just print 2 of them. There is a hollow one if you're looking to save a bit of filament (this is the option I took). But I also provided a solid one that will print in a better orientation if you're able to spare the extra filament. The solid option will also provide more weight which could add to the realism of it. I hope you enjoy printing this! :) 
Print Settings: 
Rafts: No Support: Minimal Resolution 0.3mm Infill: 20% 
All of these settings are more or less flexible. The only supports you'll need are for the little slot on the bottom of the bigger portion of it. But they aren't strictly necessary. I didn't use any supports while printing, I just had to do some clean up. I printed at 0.3mm layer height but you could increase that for better details. I was just trying to save some filament. And infill doesn't matter too much here. 
Post-Processing: Step 0: Print all the parts. 
Step 1: Sand the parts down as much as possible. The details on the handle and the outside of the hammer can be pretty hard to get smooth, but do your best. The sides of the hammer should be completely smooth to the touch though. Start with a coarse grit sandpaper in the ballpark of 100 grit. Then move up to 400 or above to get the best results.
Step 2: Glue the parts together. Use the printed pins to hold the parts in place, then apply glue to those pins to adhere them together. I used a Gorilla Glue Two Part Epoxy, glued the parts and held them for a bit until they dried. Then once the parts are together, take a paint brush or something similar to apply the epoxy generously over any cracks or seams you want to cover. Then once the glue has dried completely, sand the areas over seams to get those smoothed down as well. 
Step 3: Prime the hammer. We chose to use a black spray primer from Krylon. Coat the hammer at least twice, letting it dry completely in between coats. Just lightly spray across the surface using a normal spray painting technique. Don't stress too much about the detailed areas at this point.
Step 4: Painting the hammer. We used a Hammered Metal spray paint. Specifically silver colored. Apply 3 coats of this, letting it dry completely in between. If needed, you can sand any rough areas in between coats. Just use your judgement on what looks best. The paint should fully cover the hammer.
Step 5: Paint the handle. For this you'll need a paint brush and some brown acrylic paint. Paint the brown on the lower areas of the handle, leaving the silver rings and base of the handle as is. Make use of multiple brushes to get into hard to reach areas. Apply 3 coats of this to get a smooth, but plentiful coverage of paint. You can always go back over the details on the handle with silver paint if you need to. 
Step 6: Apply a wash. I won't go into a ton of detail about the wash. You can YouTube ""applying a wash to miniatures"" if you want more details. We took some silver and black acrylic paint, mix it and watered it down significantly then applied it to the details on the handle and on the sides of the hammer. Use a paper towel or spare paint brush to dab off excess. This will give the recessed areas a more defined shadow. 
Step 7: Rough it up. This step involves taking sand paper to the paint on the bulk of the hammer to give it a worn and used look. Go around the edges and just lightly sand it to give it a more textured look. Then take some of your paper towels you used to clean off the wash and lightly dust that darker color across the body for even more texture. 
Step 8: Apply a finish coat. You can get some spray clear coat and just spray the whole thing once it's completely dry and done. This will help protect it from damage like scratches to the paint.",31002,ChaosCoreTech

The other 6mm hole can be used to attach something else, or you can mount the light bulb holder to the spigot mount using it, so you can adjust the tilt tension independently from the tension on the spigot.

0,17167,Bowden extruder sponge-mount vibration dampener for NEMA 17,"SummaryThis mount uses 2 household kitchen sponges folded 90* to tightly hold the body of a NEMA 17 stepper motor-based extruder, such like the Airtripper V3. The sponges squeeze in between the inside of the mount and the body of the motor - the gap is 8mm. If you're feeding your bowden extruder with serious amps (especially if you have one of the longer-bodied NEMA 17's) you'll notice crazy vibrations coming from the motor, which if hard-mounted to the chassis of your printer can make theee most annoying sound in the known universe. You can't use the rubber mounting-face couplers with these extruders for obvious reasons, and using rubber standoffs can be a tricky trial & error process with the likelyhood that you won't find soft enough rubber. I was really surprised at the noise reduction this simple ghetto solution provides.

The 3D printed 16-bit moon is made out of gold translucent PLA which has great optical properties for this design. Lastly, this light requires 3 x AA batteries. Batteries are not included.

It stands about 2 feet high, and has a spout coming out of the gooses' beak that you can pipe water to for a fountain. It's been painted many times and the paint is thick and peeling, but it has lots of character. I decided to try to scan it and see if I could print it out in 3D.
123D Catch & Meshmixer
I took 38 photographs of the statue in my back yard from every angle, with lots of overlap. I then used 123D Catch to stitch them together into a mesh. Then I imported it into Meshmixer to clean it up a bit and output an STL file of the statue by itself, and another of the statue with supports.
The 2 files are pretty huge, buy my inexperienced efforts to reduce their size resulted in too much loss of detail.
I think overall it was a good result for a first time effort. For comparison, a video of the 123d Catch rendering is available here: https://youtu.be/lATga58Yqdc
Notes:
For the small 60 mm white model, I used MadeSolid PET+ at 250C, 30mm speed but the small size didn't allow a lot of detail. For the larger 150mm print I scaled it 3X and used Arctic Silver PLA from Cubicity at 190C . I used the uploaded file with supports already generated for both prints.",16490,Gary Fischer

I recommend printing these in a Strong material with 100% infill or having Shapeway print them out of Strong Flexiable Plastic (Nylon).  
I have printed two myself, one out of Taulmans Alloy 910, and the other with Polymakers PC-Plus.  Both feel like they should be strong enough.
*Note:  I have not had a chance to use the tool, so right now this is in Beta, and I may have to update and add changes after I have been able to use it.  But feel free to print and test yourself.  I would appreciate any feedback.

0,17275,iPhone 6/6S Plus Bumpers,"Hi Everyone
This is our design for 3D printable bumpers for an iPhone 6 or 6S Plus. The bumpers print and then immediately fit straight onto your phone straight off the bed. They are held on via friction fit. This is more than adequate to stay attached to your phone but also provides a quick way of removing the bumpers when needed. The bumpers offer a great amount of protection and look good as well.
NOTE: using the scaling feature of your slicer to decide how tight you want the bumpers to be. Keep at 100% scale if you want a loose fit or if you are printing with ABS. Scale to 97-99% for a tighter fit especially if you're printing with PLA. We found that the bumpers print best if you orientate the print so that the flat bottom/top sits flat on the build bed. We don't recommend printing the bumpers on their side. 
We printed out bumpers in our own Blue ABS filament which is available here: http://www.3dexfilament.co.uk/product.php?id=14 We used a layer height of 0.2mm and an infill of 20%, however, it doesn't matter what settings you use as this design will yield good results regardless of the printer settings.

0,17298,Printer Tolerance Test 01,"This is a fast and easy model that I designed in order to test 3D model dimensions versus actual print dimensions on all 3 axes of my printer (daVinci 1.0 Pro). The overall print size is 6.0"" x 6.0"" x 0.75"", but I've included several features to test various things: 
1)  Overall dimensions of 6.0"" x 6.0"" 
2)  The dimensions of 4 different square blocks (1"" x 1"" x 0.75"";  1.25"" x 1.25"" x 0.5"";  1.5"" x 1.5"" x 0.375"";  and 2.0"" x 2.0"" x 0.25"").  The 2"" square has a 1"" x 1"" square removed from the center, for testing inside dimensions on the X and Y axes, as well as perimeter distances of 0.25"" on all sides. 
3)  A 2.5"" diameter cylinder with a 1.5"" inside diameter, for testing circular concentricity. 
4)  In order to test fitting for fasteners, I've included four (4) different openings for 1/4-20 machine screw nuts.  I physically measured part #MS-110 from Bulldog Hardware, and included four different tolerances within the design:  Zero tolerance, 0.01"", 0.02"", and 0.03"" tolerances.  (These tolerances are measured from flat to flat on the nut... so are actually half of the tolerances listed.)  Each opening is 0.192"" deep, which should let the above-listed part number lay inside the opening with its top surface flush with the printed test part.  I've also included a 0.325"" diameter hole at the center of each opening, to help push your 1/4-20 test nut out of the opening(s), if necessary. 
As you can see from the preview images, I took the time to label each feature of the test object (other than Z heights).  I also added some small cross-members to hold the part together, should you want to save the test object for future reference.  
I have the original TurboCAD v16 file (with all 3D parts, dimensions, and subtrahends) available for anyone who might like to adjust some dimensions.  Simply message me, and I can send you that file. 
I used white PLA from Cutequeen (which I've had great luck with, by the way) using 200°C extruder/45°C bed temperatures.  The estimated print time is 4h:26m using 14.97 meters of filament... at 10% infill with 0.3mm layers and no raft or support.  I've only uploaded the Netfabb ""fixed"" version, since I found one small hole in my original .STL file.

0,17334,Part fitting test 02,"This is a design that I made in order to test-fit some parts and verify that my dimensions for a very large and complex project will work correctly.  This test part it designed to fit a Hitec HS-322HD servo... a 1.125"" O.D. bearing... and a 0.75"" bearing. I printed this object using white PLA from 'Cutequeen' with great results.  (200°C extruder and 45°C bed with blue painter's tape; 0.25mm layers; 10% infill; no raft or supports; 1h:10m print time, and consumed 3.43 meters of 1.75mm filament on my da Vinci 1.0 PRO.)
With zero cleaning of the printed part, my servo pushed right into place, quite snugly... as did both ball bearings.  In fact, it took quite a bit of force to remove them... which is exactly what I wanted.  (Which is why I made openings at the bottom of each part opening, to help push the parts out of their respective positions.) I also created a stepped ""tower"" of sorts, to test the inside diameters of the bearings.  I did not need for them to fit very tightly, and they do not.  In fact, they are quite a bit sloppier than I had expected.   However, they are more than adequate for the design that I am working on. I find that printing small test objects like this can save a LOT of time printing large objects that will simply never work.  Every 3D printer I've owned has been different, so I like to see what they are capable of, and learn their little 'quirks' before printing large, complex parts.  (ESPECIALLY if they are parts for an assembly of any kind.) I know that this object won't suit everyone's needs, but it sure suits mine.  And it's a large world, out there... I hope it can help someone else, as well. Enjoy!",42442,clint_campbell

A) Print and thread the ""keymod_nut_A""  with the appropriate 1/8"" tap.
B) Print and thread the ""Keymod_nut_B"" with the appropriate 1/8"" tap and attach a 1/8 standard nut with nylon insert on top(see pictures).

(NEED TO KNOW) i designed this box for my ramps-fd that i slightly modified. originally all the connectors are facing away from the board .and this is just annoying because the box needs to be really wide to plug in the connectors. 1. you can either bend the connectors upward very carefully and slowly with a plug attached to keep all the pins lined up. 2. if your good at soldering . you can de-solder the connectors cut the pins at the bend. keep enough to re solder into the holes on the board so all white connectors are facing upward. and also created a Radds v1 enclosure for people that have Radds . the Radds box has a mounting area on the back plate for a 30mm fan and a micro usb to usb-b adapter and the on off switch that comes with the duplicator i3 . but it still does not house the psu .. i might make a different version to acomidate the psu. but not for now..,28058,delukart

0,17368,"E3D Krakken Prusa i3 carriage with Fan, LED and Z-Stop bed level","SummaryI bought a E3D Krakken print head so I could do 4 color printing. The print head is real nice but it required a carriage for my Prusa i3. So I designed this in Sketchup Pro. I decided to include some features like - the bearing blocks and the main printhead mount are adjustable in case your Prusa's X-rails are slightly further/closer than mine are. There are loops and a zip tie hole set on either side to hold the excess wires. The Fan/LED/Z-stop bed leveler is also adjustable up/down a little so you can get it fitted slightly above the print head tips. The fan ducting only blows out in a downward direction to prevent it from blowing onto the print tips. I tried to balance the weight as best I could so it would not be too heavy toward the front, I also tried to make it as narrow as I could to give myself as much X distance possible. Once I get the printer completed and test printing I will know if anything needs tweaking but I think it is good to go as is.

0,17370,Schlotzz Bowden Extruder - By Coog,SummaryThis is my rendition of Schlotzz's Bowden extruder for 3D printing. I elected to modify his design a little. I added a thumb lever to the idler arm. I also knocked out a little bit of the tube areas so I could add a M4 nut to the tube to hold it in place instead of the typical PTFE tubing holder. The poor mans method! Please take a look. Enjoy - share! and of course all credit goes to Schlotzz for given me the original design! Thanks ~CoogInstructionsBe sure to run a 1.75-ish mm round tool through the PTFE that has been threaded by the M4 nut. This will re-open the passage so the filament can slip through it. I use a tiny flathead scewdriver that comes in a micro-screwdriver set for glasses. Just use one that is the right size. Then take a piece of your filament and slide it through with the nuts in place. If it moves freely then your safe. I also added a picture - although it is squished - of the four units I just made in preparation for the Kraken printhead I am mounting soon. Stay tuned for things that I designed and printed for the Kraken to be mounted on a standard Prusa i3 printer. See you all soon! ~Coog,61168,Coogrrr Coogrrr

Spektrum individually tests and marks the output power (in dBm) on the back of these modules, so you may want to open a few up and select the one with the highest output. Besides the spectrum module, you'll need about $5 of cable, 3.3V regulator and antenna. You may also want to to look at Dan Myers' similar project at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:293608 I built this thing after looking at his (thanks, Dan, for the motivation!) because I wanted these differences: Antenna is mounted higher Series voltage regulator instead of switching regulator to prevent EMI (switchers emit RF that can interfere with sound and signals) Cleaner internal board mounting InstructionsYou'll need: Remove the Spektrum transmitter module from a Spektrum DX4e or DX5e transmitter. Get an antenna, cable, and 3.3V regulator. Here are sources: Cable: http://www.alofthobbies.com/rf-coax-assembly-70mm.html Antenna: http://www.alofthobbies.com/2db-module-antenna.html Regulator: http://www.ebay.com/itm/371077257166 A few small screws 4.7k resistor Diode (1N4148, 1N914 or similar) 5-pin 0.1"" Dupont connector and wires Assemble. The regulator fits between two posts, and the transmitter board sits atop three posts. You'll need to carve small half-moons out one side of the Dupont connector so that the wires can exit at a right angle.

I hate the sight of it, the smell of it and I can't even comment on the taste of it because I've never wanted to get even slightly close enough to try it. But I acknowledge that I'm by far outnumbered by those who love pizza, so therefore this one is for you.
It should be easy enough to assemble, but make ABSOLUTELY SURE it's cleaned every time it's used to make sure that revolting cheese gunk doesn't build up and give you some horrible intestinal problems",27248,EnterpriseXD
