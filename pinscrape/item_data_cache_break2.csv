0,17400,Mustang P-51 small model,"A P-51 Mustang Scale model. Reduced Detail for 3D printing/ Rotating Propeller.  
Designed in Autodesk Maya. My printer is not a high performance printer, so, do not get discouraged from my printed model. 
The Model body is divided into 2 parts for ease of printing. The Spinner is also divided into 2 parts because of the propeller blades. Attach the propeller base to the propeller using Super Glue. Insert the propeller in one half of the body and glue the 2 half's of the body together.
Now you should have a complete Mustang with a rotating propeller.
Hope you enjoy.

0,17450,MK7 NinaFlex Adaptor,"SummaryI have a Prusa I3 with an MK7 extruder which I wanted to use to print Ninjaflex. If you have ever tried to print this stuff, you may have discovered it is like trying to push a wet noodle thru the extruder! The filament is so flexible and the distance between the gear and barrel will cause the filament to go anywhere but thru the nozzle. I decided to see if I could do something about that and as a result, I present to you, the Wet Noodle Adaptor... Okay, this thing looks pretty simple, but the tolerances are really really tight, so before you tackle this, make sure your bed level (goes without saying, but too many people skip this part). Slice the STL file with a layer height of .15mm with support. Bring your bed up to temperature. I use 115C on PEI. After the bed is up to temperature, set your Z axis so that you can slip a sheet of paper under it and it touches the bed and the nozzle just enough to move easily. First layer height is very critical for this part! Heat your extruder to 210C and load your ABS filament. Do not use PLA as the temperatures inside the extruder can get too warm for PLA. After printing the part, you will need to remove the little extra plastic covering the top hole for the filament and use a manual drill bit to clean out the rest of the filament hole. Remove the fan on your MK7 extruder. I have mine setup with a connector and the fan, heatsink, and spacers are glued in place so I can easily remove the fan to get to the inner works of my MK7. Slip the Wet Noodle Adapter under the gear and idler with the long side under the gear. You may have clearance problems with your grub screws holding the gear in place. If so, you can file little more flat spot on the shaft and turn the gear around to put the grub screws on the side closest to the extruder. Again, the tolerances are very tight. The adapter should fit snugly under the gear and idler with the idler lined up with the filament hole. You may or may not need to put a larger washer behind the idler. It's center must line up with the filament hole in both the adapter and the barrel. While pressing on the adaptor, make sure you can insert a piece of filament down thru the adapter into the barrel. Put the fan back on and test extrude a piece of any filament you like. If you got this far, you are ready to print Ninjaflex. I found it prints best at 10mm/s or 600mm/min. Slow is good. 240C Extruder temp. I reduced my flow rate to 95% and dialed down the speed to around 7.5mm/s and got a nice shiny finish on my F1 tires which took about 6 hours to print. Before starting the print, let about 15mm of ninjaflex extrude and start the print while it continues to ooze. If you wait too long, the filament will blob up inside the nozzle. That's why I start the print while it is still oozing and stringy. You can remove it after the print gets under way. Anyway, hope this helps some of you who have tried and failed to print Ninjaflex on your Prusa I3. See it in action... https://youtu.be/2pkTmWo1C0w https://youtu.be/2c8DDbqSJDQ",58020,Flashsolutions

0,17452,SHANGHI CARD GAME,"SummaryThis is a set of parts for a card game that can be played for money or just for fun. It includes a one cent coin, a five cent coin, and a cup to hold the coins. The quantity of cups and coins can be printed as desired. I printed 1 large cup and 4 smaller cups sized at 80% of the original along with 42 one cent coins and 40 five cent coins which accommodates four players. The coin cups can be scaled if you prefer, as I did, to 80% to make 4 smaller cups and leave the cup at 100% to be used for the pot. Print as many 80% cups as you will have players, up to 7, maybe 8. The game requires two decks of card, three if 5 or more players. The rules for the game are as follows: For 4 players, I let the bank give out 4 five cent coins and 10 one cent coins to each player for a starting bank roll. If a player runs out before the end of the game, he/she can buy more from the bank. SHANGHAI – RUM A LA MARCELLE GAME RULES Everyone puts a nickle in the pot DEAL – 12 cards – 1 to 4 – 2 decks ---- 5,6, or 7 people – 3 decks JOKERS and TWO's are wild ACE can be high or low SET = 3 or more of a kind as in 4 hearts, 4 diamonds, 4 clubs RUN = 4 or more of the same suit as in 3,4,5,6 of Diamonds You may buy a JOKER by paying $.05 to the owner when it is laid down and by trading it with the card it represents. You cannot buy after you spread. Spread can only include the initial cards even if you have more, they have to be played on next turn. You cannot trade with other wild card. Anyone can claim the top of the discard pile but must also draw an extra penalty card from the staock without discarding. No new matched sets are allowed. After you spread, you can play on any player's sets. Each hand ends when a player has played all his cards. Loosers put a penny in for each card left in their hand. The winner takes the nickles, pennies, pot. FIRST HAND -------- 2 SETS OF THREE SECOND HAND ------- 1 SET OF THREE AND 1 RUN OF FOUR THIRD HAND -------- 2 RUNS OF FOUR FOUTH HAND -------- 3 SETS OF THREE FIFTH HAND -------- 2 SETS OF THREE AND 1 RUN OF FOUR SIXTH HAND -------- 2 RUNS OF FOUR AND 1 SET OF THREE SEVENTH HAND ------ 3 RUNS OF FOUR -- DEAL 13 CARDS FOR THIS HANDPrint SettingsPrinter Brand: RepRapPrinter: Prusa I3Rafts: NoSupports: NoResolution: .3mmInfill: 30%Notes: I printed the cups in clear PLA and the coins in contrasting colors, yellow on black and black on white.

I drilled a mounting hold in my existing Z endstop to allow it to be mounted on the stepper motor plate. I had to file a square area for the limit switch since it had to go on the other side. I suggest using PLA as it is harder and more stable than ABS. For the arrow component, make sure you start the threads so the screw goes in straight. I did this while still on the bed. Then when you thread it onto the adjustment screw, allow the screw to protrude about a quarter inch past the disc so that only the screw engages the limit switch. If you insert an M600 command at layer height Z=2.2, you can change filament colors to have a contrasting color for the arrow.How I Designed ThisI printed this at .2mm using Black and Yellow PLA.

If you use Slic3R, which a lot of people do, you can get by with 2 perimeters. If using Simplify3D, I would recommend 4 to 5 perimeters to prevent gaps from forming at the intersection of the walls.Post-PrintingFor a Glossy smooth finish, use an Acetone Vapor BathI like to give all my ABS pieces a nice shiny look, so I use an empty paint can purchased from Home Depot lined with paper towels held in place with magnets. The paint cans from Home Depot make a perfect vapor chamber and come with a lid that seals in the vapor. I soak the paper towels with Acetone just enough to wet them all the way thru. I apply the Acetone with a 60ml syringe which works well to wet the towel evenly. I cut the paper towels to fit the bottom of the can as well. I also picked up a 5 1/2"" glass mirror at the dollar store and trimmed the plastic edges so that the mirror can fit into the paint can. It had suction cups on the bottom which I removed and inserted stiff wires to be able to lift the mirror out of the paint can. I also line the top of the mirror with aluminum foil to keep any melted plastic from sticking to the mirror. The mirror just provides a nice flat surface for the aluminum foil. To cut the aluminum foil to fit, I place it on the paint can lid and run my thumbnail around the recess for a perfect cut.How I Designed ThisI started with a card holder by bdub_24 that I found here on Thingverse (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:854289). I added playing card insignias (Spade, Club, Heart, and Diamond) on each of 4 surfaces. Then I designed a set of 3 trays to hold the card holders. Because the overall size of the completed tray is too large for my 200 x 200 bed, I broke the card tray into 3 ABS pieces which I then glue together with PVC cement. On the bottom of the card tray are indentations to attach rubber feet. Each of the three card holders takes approximately 2 hours to print. After printing, I place them in a cold Acetone vapor chamber and let them cook for exactly 2 hours which smooths the surface imperfections and gives it a nice glossy finish. I set a timer to make sure I remove them on time, otherwise they will melt too much. After gluing the 3 card trays together, I place the completed set into a larger cold Acetone vapor chamber for 2 hours. I have to use a different container for this as the tray is too large to fit into the paint can. Each card holder is glued into the card tray after the Acetone treatment has had time to harden back up, typically 10 to 12 hours later. I should mention that the large surface area of these parts makes it particularly difficult for the ABS to adhere to the heated bed, so I use an ABS puck to spread a thin film of ABS onto the bed before printing. I simply squirt a tablespoon or so onto a COLD bed with my syringe and run the ABS puck over the Acetone just before each print. After every 3rd print, I usually clean the bed by scraping the bed with a razor blade and maybe adding a bit of Acetone to loosen it as I clean it up. A clean surface gives a much nicer print and the thin layer of ABS makes the parts stick to the glass bed better than anything else I have tried. The completed print can even be removed while the bed is still hot. I scrub the residue from the bottom of the part with a wire brush. I should also mention that I am using a Da Vinci 1.0 printer updated to use Repetier .91 firmware and Simplify3D on a MAC to create the GCODE. Slic3R repaired some open faces in my STL files that Simplify3D could not fix, so I first saved the STL file from Slic3R before using it in Simplify3D. Without increasing the infill and using only 2 perimiters like Slic3R, Simplify3D could not print the tray without leaving gaps in areas near the intersection of walls. Slic3R lays down a solid rectilinear layer before laying down perimeters on top of gaping holes in honeycomb infill and can print with only 2 perimiters. But by increasing the number of external perimiters from 2 to 5, Simplify3D renders just as well. Something to consider if you are thinking about using Simplify3D.",58020,Flashsolutions
0,17463,DaVinci 1.0 Spool Hanger,"SummaryThis is a remix of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:409100. This assumes you have a modified XYZprinter that can accept spools other than the original cartridge. The original spool hanger by Ranh316 was too small for the spools I use, so I started over using his basic premise. The spools that I use have an inside diameter of 59mm. These are 2LB spools that I order from eBay. The hanger was beefed up to support the additional weight. Bearings and end caps for the spool were created to give the spool less resistance and give the spool a centered area from which to rotate instead of dragging the spool over a rounded surface. A hex recess was added to the hanger base to fit a 4"" 1/4x20 bolt which then goes thru two bearing blocks that grip the spool and provide a smooth spool rotation. A small cutout is required in the top cover of the printer to keep the filament from slipping under the spool. I could have included a filament retainer in the print, but I had binding problems with the original version and found that an opening in the lid works better. Thread the filament from the right side of the spool as shown in the photo. Additional parts you will need are a 4"" 1/4x20 hex head bolt. Two 1/4x20 nuts, optional washers. Two 5/8 OD 1/4 ID bearings. Note: Bearings are a press fit. Use a vice to press them in place. You will need to print two copies of the bearing block. InstructionsThis will require supports since there is an overhang present. Print two copies of the bearing block. Bearings are pressed into place with a bearing press or vice as this is made to be have a very tight fit. You should cut a small rectangle in the lid of your printer to ensure the filament does not ride under the spool. Insert the 1/4x20 hex head 4"" bolt into the recessed area of the spool holder and secure with one 1/4x20 nut. Place one bearing block on the bolt and then put the filament spool in place, securing with the other bearing block and one more nut. Tighten securely. Optionally, you might want to use a wing nut on the outside end cap rather than a nut. Would make it easier to swap spools.",58020,Flashsolutions

0,17468,Double Domino Havoc - A 3D printed Game of Skill and Chance,"SummaryA few years ago, I designed a game called “Board Dominoes” which was sold online at TheGameCrafters.com website and thru my own website. I still play the game often with friends and family and everyone loves it. Someone recently asked me if I was still selling the game and it dawned on me that now that I had a 3D printer, I could actually make a newer version of it in plastic and share it with those who have access to a 3D printer. Since the 3D version would not be played on a game board any longer, I have renamed the game “Double Domino Havoc” in honor of how I have come to learn the game is actually played. You will learn this too should you decide to print it. The game comes in two sizes, but I am only sharing the travel size version here since it can be printed in one print operation. Each rack takes approximately 7 hours to print and the number of racks you print depends on how many players are going to play the game (up to 8). I prefer the numbered dominoes versus the ones with dots. The dominoes are not included in the 3D print. You can purchase a Mexican Train Fun Size Numbered Dominoes double 12 set for use with up to 8 players or a double nine set for playing with four to six players. The 3D print creates a single rack which contains sections for holding dominoes. You will need one rack for each person who wishes to play. The object of the game is simple, be the first person to move 6 dominoes from the tray area of the rack to play zone. But winning the game is not as easy as it sounds. Read the rules of doubles to learn why. InstructionsPrinted at .25mm with infill of 25% and no supports required. The rack comes in 3 pieces, so you will have to glue them together. I use ABS plastic filament, so I glue it with PVC pipe cement. The center direction arrows can also be glued together to form a single element. The direction arrows come in handy for remembering the player rotation order which changes frequently throughout the game. The game rules follow: Rules for Double Domino Havoc (Previously known as Board Dominoes) Double Domino Havoc is an addicting game of skill and cshance that is simple to play, but difficult to win. The objective is quite simple. Move 6 dominoes from your tray area to the 6 spaces above it as you draw tiles from the boneyard or optionally from the face up tiles at the top of each players domino rack, all the time while discarding a tile to keep a fixed number of dominoes in play. The first person to move their six dominoes from the tray area to the center section of their rack is the winner of the round. The number of rounds can be any agreed upon number to make up a single game. A full size (2”x 1”) set of Double 12 Dominoes (Not Included!) is required for play with 8 players although a Double 9 set is suitable for 6 or less players. Each domino holder (called the rack) is divided into three sections. The bottom section contains slots for holding up to seven dominoes. The center section holds six dominoes and the top section holds one domino which is for the discarded dominoes. To begin play, place the entire set of dominoes face down on the table and mix up the tiles. This will become the boneyard from which players will have a choice from which to draw. Note: Players may also draw from face up dominoes located on each players discard section of their player rack. Place the direction token in the center of the table with the Clockwise direction arrow facing up. Determine who will start first using any number of methods such as draw for high point, etc. Any number of players from 2 to 8 may play but at least 3 are needed to make use of the clockwise and counterclockwise rules described in the RULES OF DOUBLES section below. The game starts by having each player take 6 dominoes from the boneyard and placing them in the tray area of their rack. The first player starts by taking one additional domino from the boneyard and adding it to their tray. The player then arranges these 7 dominoes to obtain the best sequential train they can form. This is the only time you will have more than 6 dominoes in your tray! At the completion of your play, you will be discarding one of the 7 dominoes. The domino at the head of this train is then placed in the center section of their rack in the first empty space nearest the top of the rack. The player must then discard one domino from their tray face up to the space in the top of the rack. You want to try to play your highest numbers as soon as possible because whatever is left in your tray is counted against you at the end of the round. At the completion of each play there should always be a total of six dominoes between a player's tray and the six playing spaces on the rack. (This does not include the space for one domino at the top of the rack used for discards). After each of the players has completed their first round of play, there should now be one domino from each player in the top section of their rack facing up. These dominos are now available to be taken in lieu of drawing from the boneyard. Each round of play consists of drawing one domino, playing a domino if possible (to the center of their rack), and then removing and discarding one domino face up to the top of their rack in the discard section so that you are always left with six dominos in play between your tray and that of your train. The center section of each rack contains six vertical recessed areas in which your sequential train is playe",58020,Flashsolutions

0,17472,Magnetic Fast Track Game,"SummaryFast Track is one of a number of North American race games in which cards are used to control movement of pieces around the board. The rules can be found on the Internet at http://www.pagat.com/race/fast_track.html I wanted something unique, so I designed pieces that could snap into place with magnets. The board is approximately 20"" in diameter, so I made individual sections which could be 3D printed and then glued to a round wooden board. It takes a lot of magnets, but Harbor Freight has them in packs of 10 for $2.99 each. You will need 16 packages since there are 157 magnets total. I purchased the round board in which to mount the 3D pieces at Home Depot. I coated the round board with an epoxy coating that is glossy and looks like 50 coats of varnish. Paint and glue completes the list of materials you will need to provide. I added the railroad tracks and a train engine just for the fun of it. Fast Track.... get it. I know, my sense of humor showing. InstructionsAfter printing all of the individual pieces, I used Locktite Super Glue to glue one magnet to one of the magnet holders and then glued that to one of the player pieces. This piece is then used to ensure that the rest of the magnets you place on the board pieces are glued correctly. Let a magnet snap into place on the player piece. Then put a drop of super glue in one magnet holder. Pull the magnet from the player piece and insert it into the magnet holder so that the magnetic side faces the holder such that it will snap to the player piece. Place a drop of glue on one of the board pieces and use the player piece to align the magnet holder as you insert it into the hole in the board piece. Repeat this procedure until all of the board pieces are glued in place and the player piece snaps to each in the board. When all of the board pieces are complete, use one of them to reverse the process for the remaining player pieces. I recommend printing the magnet holders in a different color than the rest of the game pieces. I did not do that myself and ended up creating more work for myself when it came time to paint. You will need 6 colors of paint for the project as there are 6 player positions. Each has a different color for its home row and start pen. There are some magnets that are designated Fast Track zones. I painted mine accordingly. Refer to the game rules for more details on how to color code the board. Using a graphtec vinyl cutter and some black and white pieces of vinyl, I cut some circles and rings out of the vinyl and applied them to the board and player pieces to differentiate some of the colors and to make it stand out. For the darker colors, I used white and for the lighter colors I used black.",58020,Flashsolutions

0,17479,Cookie Stamp,"SummaryThis was a project to produce a number of Cookie Stamps for my wife's cutout cookies.InstructionsThis is the process I used to create items such as this Cookie Stamp. I wanted to use Graphtec's Silhouette Studio to design my stamps because it offers an excellent tracing mechanism and ability to wrap text along a path such as a circle. I also wanted to use Autodesk 123Design to import an SVG file as a sketch and then extrude the sketch into a 3D object which could be exported as an STL file. I should mention I have a MAC Mini and would like to be able to use it exclusivly, but I also have various flavors of Windows Operating systems running on it as virtual PC's in Parallels Desktop. What seemed so simple turned out to be quite complicated for reasons I will explain. Silhouette Studio, it turns out will not let you export SVG files with the latest version, so you need an older Version like Version 1.9 to accomplish this. You also must use the premium paid version of Silhouette Studio Designer Edition in order for it to work. There are articles on the internet showing how to run both versions of Silhouette Studio for those who want to use all the latest features that version 3 provides. While AutoDesk 123Design is available (free) for MAC and PC, the MAC version does not properly import SVG files containing text. However, the PC version does work with no issues. The problem with that is that my PC is a virtual PC and Autodesk 123Design runs very slowly and is next to impossible to work on in the virtual environment. I am using Windows 8.1 as my virtual PC. So given the above issues, here is how I go about making a 3D STL file using the above tools. Open Silhouette Studio Designer Version 1.9 on the PC and create a new project. Create your design using the tracing tools, whatever. Save the file changing the extension from .studio to .svg Import the SVG file into AutoDesk 123Desgin (PC version). Save it as a 123 file. Now you can open the 123 File on the MAC and complete extruding the components and exporting the resulting project to an STL file. When creating a cookie stamp, the text must be reversed or mirrored in order to be viewed properly when used to stamp a cookie. Silhouette Studio allows you to mirror the text and place it on a path. Be careful when forcing it to a path. I created a circle as a path. Pulling the text to the circle sometimes places it on the inside rather than the outside of the circle. Using a bigger circle sometimes helps and then you can resize the circle after placing the text. For the handle on the cookie stamp, I placed a cyclinder on the grid of Autodesk 123Desgin and then placed a sphere on top of it. Pulling ths sphere down till it was half way thru to the cylinder produced the handle I then exported as an STL file. I glue the handle to the cookie stamp using PVC cement. I also made a few versions of the handle by modifying it in AutoDesk MeshMixer. This has been a learning experience. Took me two days to sort out all of the issues, but I can now easily create Cookie Stamps in any flavor I like. Some have a picture of a glass on them, others have different sayings. Oh, by the way, I scale the STL file to 35% before printing. You can scale it to suit the size cookie you wish to make. Hope you can benefit from my experience.",58020,Flashsolutions

CascaquaTM is a Home Aquaponics System released free to the 3D printing community to promote sustainable technology and healthy living. The patent pending CascaquaTM – Cascading Aquaponics System is a closed loop ecologically balanced system that combines the cultivation of plants without soil and the cultivation of fish (hydroponics and aquaculture). It is essentially a mini ecological system where the plants care for the fish and the fish care for the plants symbiotically. Aquaponics is considered the most natural method of growing organic produce as the produce is entirely free of chemicals which surprisingly not all organic produce is. It is also a very effective method of caring for your fish because the filtration system is natural, continuous and it oxygenates the water. The Cascaqua features a sculptural tower of cascading grow beds stacked above a beautifully crafted fish bowl. A quiet pump keeps the water recirculating, the pump sound is completely masked by the tranquil trickling as the water reenters the fish bowl. Start manufacturing your own Cascaqua free by downloading and 3D printing the Cascaqua parts here. You will also need to source a fish bowl, pump and flexible tube all of which can easily be sourced from Amazon. Parts info: – 270mm diameter fish bowl with a 170mm diameter opening. – 300L/hour submersible pump. – 8mm O.D. flexible tube. – Printables required qty’s: Cacade planter (qty 5), Outrigger 1 (qty 3), Outrigger 2 (qty 1), Base (qty 1). Note; you may need to adjust the outriggers to suit your fish bowl.

0,17517,Insectbot Mini parts for easier assembly and functionality,"I created these parts for the Insectbot Mini that is made by dfrobot.com and is available at various other electronic and robotic kit sites. This is a fun little project but the final assembly is a bit on the rough side so I decided to clean it up a bit and give it a more finished professional look. There are only two different parts that I created that need no assembly. The first piece is that back that adds addition stability to the sensors that are used for the eyes plus a place to wind the excess wires from the servos and sensor instead of bunching them up, using zip ties and letting them hang. The neck is attached at the base and is just wide enough to fit over the front servo. You can attach it with double-sided tape or glue it like I did. You will need to make two small holes to attach the sensor to for the zip ties to go through or attach the sensor with double sided tape. I would have put the holes in but I have read that there are some different sensors that can be in the kit. The second is the back that has a slot for the battery for easy removal for recharging and a platform for the circuit board so that you can easily access the pins, plugs, and micro usb port for programming. This part fits over the back sensor the same way as the neck and can be attached with double-sided tape or glued. These two parts add a great deal of functionality and a neater design to the finished product.",52753,ronaldcanderson

0,17541,Dice Tower and Storage,"Dice games are fun, but having them fly across the table and knock over other pieces is not. Finally a solution. 
A dice tower offers a confined space to roll as many dice as needed, while collecting them all together for counting.  This design doubles as a storage space for dice not in use, with detachable drawers that pop out of the walls. 
Modeled with each floor as a separate piece, the tower can be printed with no supports and minimal infill. The structures align at clear points to be easily assembled with your solvent or glue of choice. 
The walls fit snugly behind a lip along the rim. Insert and then push gently down to snap them into place. Some sanding may be required to ensure a smooth fit. The tower is approximately 5.3 inches in diameter The roof is approximately 6.9 inches in diameter The entryway including collection area is approximately 7.5 inches at its longest dimension. 
:Updates/Experiments: 
-I've added an alternate roof which slopes inward to funnel dice into the tower 
-I've added an alternate first floor to allow the drawbridge to fold up.  Attaching a bent paperclip will allow you to secure the drawbridge gate to the bars on the second floor. 
-I've downscaled both variants of the roof to eliminate the overhang from the rest of the tower. This and the rising drawbridge should accommodate a 6inch build plate.

0,17577,"The Cyclone: triple lift, triple track marble machine","This is a marble machine with a lift that lifts three (or more) marbles simultaneously, and releases them to three separate tracks. Two of those tracks are connected in series, so a marble will therefore alternate between those tracks. The third track loops back onto itself, so to have traffic in all three tracks, you need at least two marbles. The machine has been designed for 8 mm balls as marbles, and the machine prints completely without supports if you have a well tuned printer. 8 mm steel balls will work fine, but I have also included a printed marble that can be used. The nice thing about printed marbles is that you can print several in different colors, which looks quite cool when running the machine. They also run a little slower than steel balls due to a little more friction against the tracks. Total amount of plastic to print this will be around 300 grams.
Print Settings:
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: Any
Infill: 15%
Notes: These settings are valid for the machine itself, the screw and the cap.
Instructions
Step 1
Print the machine itself first. This will be a long print, as it is a large object. I printed mine on a Duplicator i3 with a layer height of 0.25, infill 15% and a speed of 50 mm/s, sliced with S3D. The print time was a bit over 19 hours for the machine alone.
Step 2
Print the screw, the cap and the winder, these can be printed simultaneously, but I'd recommend placing the screw centered on the bed if you have a laterally moving bed. It is a tall print with little surface area, so ensure you have good adhesion to the bed. I'm printing on glass with a glue stick, and had no issues printing it. However, adding a brim might be a good idea if you have issues with the print being knocked down. Just make sure to clean the edge where the brim attaches to the part, as this should be quite sharp to wedge under the marbles at the start of the lift. The winder could use a little support just under the indentation, but I printed it without. I had to remove a tiny bit of stringing inside the indentation, but that's to be expected with no support.
Step 3
If you don't have steel balls of the correct size, try printing some marbles. Make sure to print them at 100% infill and a very fine resolution (I used 0.1 mm). The marbles are ready to print, and has been designed with built-in support that breaks away quite easily and leaves no scars on the ball. The part of the ball that is at the bottom of the support might need just a little sanding/filing to make the ball as round as possible.I made a quick video that shows how to assemble and use the machine. Sorry about the not-so-great video, it was just a quick and dirty shoot to show that the machine works quite well.

Millibot in action >>> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAmfD0BB9do
The MilliBot uses two low cost DC powered motors (1 motor x $2 AUD + 1 motor x $0.70 AUD). One DC motor powers the vibrating bristles to move the MilliBot around and the other DC motor is used as a spinning weapon to attack. I have special designed this model for 3D printing and all parts have been thoroughly tested.
Have fun printing multiple MilliBots and battling them against each other. This is the second installment of the BashBots series.

If you'd like to go this route, print tpge-xcarriage-wm3nuts.stl and use that part instead. Update 1-30-2016 - I am also working on a 2-piece solution (No back covers) that is similar to the one that BigCooter did for the 10mm smooth rods. This will also be available for download here shortly. The BigCooter 10mm version is available here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1297618 This x-carriage is designed with the following considerations: Utlilizes the Prusa i3 format for 8mm smooth rods placed 45mm apart. A perfect mount for the Toranado Precision Geared Extruder that maximizes Z-axis print height. The TPGE can be found here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1246951 Can be removed or installed onto the printer without disassembly of the x-axis idler or x-motor mount. Contains an integrated X-axis belt holder. Uses the same mounting pattern spacing as the i3 Rework.

0,17617,Spool Holder - Wall Mount (Optimized for Hatchbox 1.75mm),"SummarySimple and easy-to-print modular wall-mount spool holder.InstructionsInspiration for innovation can happen in the strangest of places. In this case, I was in the middle of my ordinary morning routine, when I looked to my right at a standard toilet paper holder. 3 hours later this model was completed in CAD - this design is a remix of almost every toilet paper holder used in North America. Time and time again, the toilet has been that fruitful place where many a light bulb has gone off in my mind. This modular spool holder is designed to be used with any 1.75mm Hatchbox brand spool (or any 8"" diameter spool of the same width). Spool Example: http://www.amazon.com/Hatchbox-1-75mm-3D-Printer-Filament/dp/B00J0ECR5I/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1442862294&sr=8-1&keywords=hatchbox+pla The assembly consists of three printable parts: spoolbracket-RIGHT.stl (Right Bracket) spoolbracket-LEFT.stl (Left Bracket) spoolbracket-base.stl (Wall-Mount Base) I have also included the .STP CAD file for those who would like to modify and edit the 3D data in a CAD software (spool-holder-assy.stp). Assembly Notes: The parts are held together with 6x 14mm M3 screws. I always get my stainless steel button head screws from Mcmaster-Carr. Here's a link to order them: http://www.mcmaster.com/#92095a168/=z1d7m5 The 6x mounting holes in the base are sized for M3 tapping (they print at 2.5mm dia.). Once tapped, the holes accept M3 screws perfectly. If you don't have a drill and tap set, I highly recommend that you do, and you can get one here: http://www.harborfreight.com/metric-drill-tap-deburr-bit-set-95529.html. The bits both drill and tap the hole to the proper size in one simple operation. The larger 3 wall mounting holes in the base are designed to be finish-drilled with a 4.5mm bit (or equivalent). 1"" or 3/4"" PVC can be used as the reel pin. I used 3/4"" PVC cut to 3.75 inches and it works perfectly. All 3 parts on the finished spool holder shown in the images were done with 18% infill and black Hatchbox PLA. They printed up wonderfully.",62824,Weber3DPrinting

0,17628,Robot Minifigure Trio,"Three robotic figures designed with classic video game character archetypes in mind. 
The first, cyclops oval shaped robot, is a scout/ medic support for the team. The second, tank bot, is the heavy, slow, armor plated fortress with a cannon and turret. The third, bipedal walker bot, is the quick, nimble soldier robot equipped with light weaponry and high maneuverability. 
All parts print without supports, however the SoldierLegs.stl includes its own custom support to avoid multiple files for the two legs. Also, the Minionlegs.stl should be printed upside down with its top on the print bed and its feet in the air, with a brim or raft. 
Default size is around 50mm tall, and is as small as possible for the more detailed parts. 
My minifigures were printed on a Printrbot Simple Metal using white Hatchbox 1.75mm PLA, at a resolution of .2 with a slow print speed of around 30 mm/s for detailed parts like the soldier legs and the minion legs. 
Individual character models will be uploaded to my page soon! http://www.thingiverse.com/RJ_12/about
I would love to see your prints of my robots, and any modifications you add to make them look different!

Sliding shape is quite the same, and his design proved me that this principle work fine. I use same CC license Non Commercial, so it could be considered as a continuity or at least as an interpretation because of differents needs. 
By the way, thanks to Tony D, for all his sharing and vidéos.

0,17724,iPhone 6/6s Speaker Dock,"Summary
Here is my first ever 3D model of a passive speaker dock for the iphone 6/6s. 
The Dock has room for both a 3.5mm jack for an audio out and a lightning cable. 
You can use standard apple lightning cable or any generic lightning cable (I used an insignia lightning port from Best Buy best their are cheaper) you can find at your local electronic store. I have tried both ABS and PLA on this model and they both sound terrific. Although I recommend using wood filament with a 60%-90% infill to increase the bounce sound. I prefer using wood/bamboo filament as shown in the pictures because it looks cooler too :).
Print Settings
Printer Brand: PrintrbotPrinter: Simple Black
Rafts: Yes
Supports: Yes
Infill: 30%
Notes: I recommend printing this speaker on its side to limit the amount of lift. I had some warping issues when printing the object as it is.
I recommend using supports for this model so that the dome where the sounds travels out of the block has an almost spherical shape. This part is important if you want the sound to travel better and it looks cool. How I Designed This I designed this in the attempt to increase the sound of my speaker. I used a old school boombox for the 80's as my inspiration.

0,17727,LED Bracket for the Printrbot Simple Metal,"----- Summary -----
The LED Bracket helps shine light onto your extruder, making it easier to see the filament as it extrudes. Ideally, the bracket swivels, giving you light source flexibility to move for better angles for taking pictures. This LED Bracket is not compatible with ""print one at a time"" settings.
----- Print Settings -----
Printer Brand: Printrbot
Printer: Simple Black
Rafts: Yes
Supports: No
----- How I Designed This -----
I used a small LED Strip with double sided tape to attach it to the curved bracket. The bracket is held by a clip which fits onto the metal sensor as seen on the picture. I used a M3 bolt to hold it all together. The light shines onto the hotend, making it easier to see the filament being extruded. It is not ideally made for fan shrouds that cover the entire hotend but I haven't tried it yet. I got this idea from this link here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:628954 and modified it to suit my astheitic needs. Extra Materials Here are the materials that I used to pull this off: LED Strips DC adapter M3 Bolt and nut sandpaper (100 grit works fine)

I sent them a polite message via eBay asking them to take it down and this is the response I received:
""When you uploaded your items onto Thingiverse for mass distribution, you lost all rights to them whatsoever. They entered what is known in the legal world as ""public domain"". The single exception to public domain rules are ""original works of art"". No court in the USA has yet ruled a CAD model an original work or art. Therefore, you have no right to exclude others from utilizing the CAD models you have uploaded. Furthermore, if in the future we do get a precedent in the USA for establishing CAD models as ""original works of art"", we would still likely be just fine as we are not re-selling your CAD models, but rather ""transformative"" adaptions of them in the form of 3D printed objects.
SFE P.S. When you created these CAD files, did you really want to limit the amount of people who could enjoy them to the 0.01% of the USA with a 3D Printer? 100% of America can purchase the items from us at a reasonable cost and enjoy them-creating made in the USA jobs in the process as well. Furthermore, if you hate the idea of people profiteering from your work, you may want to take it up with Makerbot/Stratasys who only hosts Thingiverse for AD revenue, to sell more 3D printers.""

Normally when I put things away for storage in the garage or in the attic, I put my stuff in a plastic box with lid and then I put in a small can with some calcium-chloride salt. This is great at keeping the air inside the box at a low humidity and the stuff in the box free of mold.
However metal cans and salt is not great together so I made this plastic salt container. It has a top and a bottom. The top contains the salt that absorbs the humidity in the air. It has a small hole in the bottom so water can drip down in the bottom part. The two parts are sealed with a O-ring and held together with three bolt and can be separated so you can empty out the water when it is full.
Note. The size of the holes are made for a brass insert. I will publish a version with smaller holes shortly.

0,17860,Davinci 1 left Y axis carriage for 15mm x 8mm linear bearings,"Finally an easy to print and accurate left Y axis carriage solution for the Davinci 1. This allows for the use of 15mm OD x 8mm ID linear ball bearings for better accuracy. The model is two piece which when bolted together in the natural state can relieve any misalignment stresses between the X and Y axis components. Attach the bottom half to the X axis rods and the top half to the Y axis rod and then bolt the two carriage halves together. Attach the X and Y axis belts after securely assembling the Y axis carriage halves.
Required parts are, 
4ea) 3mm x 16mm screws. 
4ea) 3mm nuts, 
2ea) quality 15mm x 8mm linear bearings, 
1ea) 8mm hardened rod, machined to fit the Da Vinci1 chassis.
Uses the original belt tensioning mechanism.
IMPORTANT!! 
You need to add your own flag for the end stop switch. The model has no flag for this.
Linear bearing bores are 15.2mm to allow for model shrinkage
Rod holes are 8.5mm to allow for model shrinkage
Both linear bearing bores and rod bores should be reamed to size for model accuracy.
If your 3D printer is very accurate, or makes perfect holes, you may need to resize the bearing and rod bores on the model stl file to suit your needs.",29346,chris_call
0,17861,Pickle fork style slingshot,"A little slingshot for adults that know how to use them. Quite an easy print. I use mine with relatively weak rubber and little jello lollies to shoot paper targets inside. Which is pretty fun since with the right jello lollies, they are hard enough  to make a clean hole in a paper target but doesn't ricochet or even damage the paint on the walls. 
Please check for strength before use. I checked by attaching paracord to the forks and giving it a good hard pull to ensure that it was structurally sound. Safety glasses are a good idea as well because rubber can snap and hit the eye.  
Please keep within your local laws, use safety glasses at all times, use soft ammo, be an adult and do not point it at people or use to harm animals.",64781,benzidrine

0,17879,GadgetGrip,"English: The GadgetGrip is an electronic tablet accessory. Its function is to hold or grip a tablet in the most comfortable way possible compared to conventional  electronic tablets covers or protection. With GadgetGrip, you can use your tablet in any position, whether it’s standing, seated or laying down without putting strain on your posture. Furthermore, you can remove the handle in order to pack it away in a backpack or handbag without having to remove its whole structure.   The design of the GadgetGrip is based on the idea of the already comercialised product “TakeTab”, which is a handle with a sucker sticking itself on the back of your electronic tablet. After some time (several months), the sucker looses its elasticity and tends to unstick itself. The GadgetGrip aims to have the same function as TakeTab, with the added advantage/benefit of not losing grip. The red claws holding the tablet are designed for the iPad air 2 . if you own another type of electronic tablet, you just need to print the corresponding holders and fix them to the universal black base, fitting any brand of electronic tablet of a similar size. As this is the type of electronic tablet I own, I can only share this one kind of grip for now.   
Español: GadgetGrip es un accesorio para tablets. Su función es la de sujetar o agarrar nuestra tablet de una forma más cómoda de lo que ofrecen las fundas convencionales. Con GadgetGrip podrás usar tu tablet en cualquier posición, sea de pie, sentado o estirado sin posturas forzadas. Además podrás quitar el vástago para poder guardar tu tablet en una cartera o mochila sin tener que retirar toda la estructura. GadgetGrip está basado en un producto comercial llamado TakeTab. TakeTab es un vástago que incorpora una ventosa que se pega al tablet por la parte posterior. Con el paso del tiempo la ventosa ha perdido elasticidad y se despega con mucha frecuencia. GadgetGrip tiene el mismo objetivo, pero con la ventaja de que no se despega. Las pinzas de color rojo que abrazan el tablet están diseñadas para el iPad air 2. Si dispones de un tablet diferente solo tienes que imprimir la pinza necesaria para él y encajarla en la base de color negro que es universal para cualquier tablet de dimensiones parecidas. Solo tengo un modelo de tablet, por este motivo solo comparto este modelo de pinza.
Instructions English: I recommend printing the parts the way you will find them in the STL archives . It is very important to do so in order to get them to perfectly fit into each other as this operation requires a very high level of precision, as well as glue the parts together once printed.

0,17890,Reclining Buddha,"This model commemorates Makha Bucha, a Buddhist Holiday and festival. 
Also known as Magha Puja, on the full moon of the third lunar month, seven months after Buddha began his teachings, 1,250 monks gathered to hear Buddha preach. Buddha ordained these monks and spread the principles of buddhism. 45 years later, on the same full moon in the third lunar month, Buddha again delivered his teachings shortly before his death. (source).
This model is based on the famous Reclining Buddha in the Wat Pho temple complex in Bangkok, Thailand, a colossal statue covered in gold leaf, housed inside a building (vihara). It represents Buddha in the posture he took shortly before passing.

------------
Printed with PLA & ABS!
Since the start of my obsession with 3D printing and computer aided design, Motorsports has been on my mind. The Educational Brake Caliper is my first Motorsports related design to be released to the public.
This caliper is based on a race car style brake caliper featuring quick release brake pads and dual pistons. This caliper is FULL SIZED and was modeled off of a Dwarf Car style Race Car.
Instead of uploading a somewhat complicated design to Pinshape and letting you try to figure out what you have, I've opted to include some significant documentation so that this caliper can be shown and used as a hands-on educational piece. The document can be found with the STL files and is labelled, 'EducationalBrakeCaliper-Final.pdf'. 
Along with it being based on an educational design, this caliper fits perfectly on a shelf or a desk as a display showing all of its intricacies with the included display stand.
My intent with the documentation provided will be to help you with printing, assembling, understanding, teaching and testing with this caliper. My suggestion would be to have you thumb through the document before starting this print so you have an idea on how it should go. Thank you  ☺

0,17894,Inhalo - Asthma Inhaler + Spacer,"Asthma Inhaler + Spacer
An alternative to regular inhalers in the market, this inhaler features both functional and aesthetic advantages. The greatest differences are that it doesn't look like an inhaler, which grants discretion and confidence to users; and that the casing becomes a spacer (aerochamber) to facilitate inhalation.

Characteristics:
• Built-in spacer (aerochamber) that also works as casing
Spacer clicks into place for both positions, as spacer and as casing •  Discreet and elegant
Fully 3D printable
Compatible with standard medicine canisters
Available in 2 sizes (depending on canister)
Easy to clean/sterilize

To stop the display from turning off I found a free app called Stay Alive. It works fine and will keep the screen on so you don't have to keep swiping to see the picture.
There are two sizes. One is for a Samsung Galaxy 2 (my phone) and the other will take a phone up to 140mm x 74 x 12.

0,17982,Cable Chain (10 mm wide channel),"This is a cable chain I designed for use with my Shapeoko 2, a 3 axis CNC mill. The purpose is to safely guide  loose wires linking the motors on the floating x-axis carriage to the Arduino powering the system, as well as guiding the power cord for the mill safely to the edge of the work space. At the moment, the two ends of the chain are designed to be attached with strong two-sided tape or superglue. I will update if I find a better solution. 
Each link should allow for movement between 0 and 45 degrees. The male end link is inverted while the female end is in the same axis as the rest of the chains. This fits with how the two are to be attached to the Shapeoko 2.
With respect to how they go together, the material must be bendable. I had success with PLA printed at 0.25 mm per layer. Anything thicker and the sides were too rigid to snap together.
Please comment if you have suggestions for how I may improve the design.",58398,BasisFour
0,17983,OpenRC F1 Front Suspension (Updated V2),"Front shock absorbers (dampers) for Daniel's awesome F1 car!
V2 Updated Design!
______________________________________________________________________________________
I have been trying to come up with a more functional alternative for the NinjaFlex dampers in my suspension design.  (They just weren't soft enough) 
As I was changing batteries in one of my kids toys I noticed the little conical springs inside the battery compartment and I knew I had the solution!  I can now say that this design works FANTASTIC!
By adding a recessed area to the hubs I was able to fit a longer spring from an AAA battery terminal over the guide bushings and allow the full travel I was looking for.  The new attached pictures show the unassembled view with the new spring, the battery terminals I used, and the suspension both uncompressed and compressed.
The springs I used were from these battery terminals:
Keystone Electronics 5204 Contacts; Battery Spring Contacts; Negative Spring Contact with Tab, AAA, N (5 pieces)

_____________________________________________________________________________________
By adding small NinjaFlex dampers to the rigid frame of the F1 car I was able to reduce some of the bounce and vibration of the front of the vehicle as well as allow a small amount of body roll to aid in cornering.
The front upper and lower control arms have been modified to allow a sliding pivot to be attached to the wheel hubs.  Next the wheel hubs themselves were shortened vertically to allow for the placement of NinjaFlex (or possibly other materials) flexible spacers to act as small shock absorbers.
I printed the spacers out of NinjaFlex using a single layer on all sides to make them as soft as possible.  (.2mm layer height and .4mm nozzle)  Thinner would be better if you have a smaller nozzle.  The key is to make them as soft as possible.
Instructions:
Print the following:
1x Front_Upper_BOM_Suspension
1x Front_Lower_BOM_Suspension
2x Front_Wheel_Hub_Suspension (One needs to be mirrored for the opposite side of the car.)
4x OpenRC F1 Guide Bushing
2x OpenRC F1 Damper (Ninjaflex or similar)
Assemble as normal replacing BOM parts.  Thread a Guide Bushing on each new longer screw and thread it into the Front_Wheel_Hub on each side.  The smaller side of each hub faces up and gets one of the suspension spacers between it and the Upper_BOM.  Use the photo above to help with assembly if necessary.
I would welcome others to design a better/softer damper or experiment with other materials.  Small springs would probably work very well as well but I wanted to keep with the 3d-printed concept.  This is an excellent project and I'm proud to be able to contribute.
If anyone has problems being able to mirror the part ""Front_Wheel_Hub_Suspension"" I can mirror it and upload another .stl file, just let me know.",30411,ryan_hoagland

0,18006,Rainbow Light Show Enclosure,"I saw this Rainbow Light Show kit on the Adafruit web site ( https://www.adafruit.com/products/2602 ) and thought it looked really cool. The lights shift down the strip marquee style, and you control the color and brightness by moving your hands over IR sensors. It's kinetic art and lots of fun.
After I built it I knew my 4 year old niece would love playing with it. But the base, although nicely designed, was not going to be robust enough for a 4 year old. So I modeled a sturdier one using 123D Design.
I also traded out the 16 LED strip it came with for a 60 LED strip, also from Adafruit ( https://www.adafruit.com/products/1461 ). Simply remove the original strip and connect the longer one. No configuration needed.
The static pictures don't do the LED's justice; they are extremely intense even in a bright room. I shot a short video of the Rainbow in action - https://youtu.be/KHkgz6m1gns
Printing: I used Printrbot Gray PLA @ 195C. It contrasted nicely with the black bezel provided in the kit, and matched the laser cut graphics on top. .3mm layer height, 20% infill.
Assembly: The button fits loosely in the hole in the side of the enclosure. Insert it just before you screw the circuit board in place and it should rest against the reset switch. You should hear a click when you press and release the switch
The holes in the screw columns are sized to use the 2 screws that came in the kit. Carefully cut threads in them by running the screws slowly down into the holes before you actually assemble the unit.
One mod you might consider is adding a 3.5mm stereo headphone jack beside the power plug. Then connect the LED strip to a corresponding plug to enable you to remove the LED strip from the controller.",16490,Gary Fischer

This allows for the use of 15mm OD x 8mm ID linear ball bearings for better accuracy. The model is two piece which when bolted together in the natural state can relieve any misalignment stresses between the X and Y axis components. Attach the bottom half to the X axis rods and the top half to the Y axis rod and then bolt the two carriage halves together. Attach the X and Y axis belts after securely assembling the Y axis carriage halves.
Required parts are,
4ea) 3mm x 16mm screws.
4ea) 3mm nuts,
2ea) quality 15mm x 8mm linear bearings,
1ea) 8mm hardened rod, machined to fit the Da Vinci1 chassis.
IMPORTANT!!
You need to add your own flag for the end stop switch. The model has no flag for this.
Linear bearing bores are 15.2mm to allow for model shrinkage
Rod holes are 8.5mm to allow for model shrinkage
Both linear bearing bores and rod bored should be reamed to size for model accuracy.
If your 3D printer is very accurate, or makes perfect holes, you may need to resize the bearing and rod bores on the model stl file to suit your needs.",29346,chris_call

The Submachine Gun or SMG is an automatic weapon available inWolfenstein: The New Order and Wolfenstein: The Old Blood. It is the standard-issue primary weapon of the Allied Forces in 1946 and the first weapon used by the player
The Submachine Gun is a fast-firing weapon with a large magazine size and low overall recoil, making it useful when engaging multiple enemies up close or for sniping. Ammunition for this weapon is very easy to find due to it sharing the same pickup type as the Handgun 1946, though firing it wildly would still result in shortage.
Although handy to have, the Submachine Gun is quickly supplanted by the vastly more useful Assault Rifle 1946, which can be picked up from the first enemy soldier encountered. Compared to its replacement the Submachine Gun is substantially weaker, harder to get ammo for and cannot be dual-wielded.

0,18024,Fun with Photo Frames,"I thought that a picture frame would be perfect design to try out my woodfill PLA.  I tried staining it and then I printed in bronzefill, translucent and regular PLA.   This easy print comes in two variations.  Both are sized for 3.5 x 5 inch photos.  There are two holes to facilitate hanging horizontally or vertically.  There is an inner ledge that will hold a piece of glass and the photo and/or photo and a piece of cardboard.   The first one I designed was  a tad too big for my Lulzbot mini so I trimmed it around the edges.  All of the photos display the mini version except for the grey one which is a bigger frame but thinner overall.   You don't even need to hang them on the wall as you can see I used my phone stand in one of the photos.

0,18040,iDi3Dprinting Plaque,"A simple test piece for your printer, test the flatness of your bed over a 60mm2 area, your steps per mm and the ability of your printer to cope with xy feature detail.
We thought it would also make a nice decorative piece, show you friends that you are a Maker.
The piece is 60mm x 60mm x 7mm, this size means that you can test the flatness of your bed and bed adherence. The lettering will give you a good idea of how well your printer deals with XY feature detail.
We created the model by importing our logo as a .SVG file into Freecad, the techniques used are the same as in our guide on creating a 20mm 3D printer calibration cube in Freecad ( https://www.idig3dprinting.co.uk/news/how-to-guides/create-a-3d-printer-calibration-cube-in-freecad/ ) . The results that you see here we tested and printed using a Prusa i3 loaded with 3Dom filaments Ingeo PLA ( https://www.idig3dprinting.co.uk/product-category/3d-printer-filament/?filter_filament-type=129 ).
How to calibrate your Steps per mm on your 3D printers axes:
You can calibrate your printers steps per min for the different axes by: e = expected dimension (y = 60mm, x = 60mm & z = 7mm ) o = observed dimension s1 = current steps per mm s2 = new steps per mm
so that
s2 = s1 x (e/0)

Assembly: Using a soldering Iron, melt the Brass Knurl Inserts into the IM Cleaner Body V2. Making sure you have a small lip of plastic over the top of the Inserts (helps keep them from pulling out) Install the SS Flat Washer onto the SS Hex Cap Screw, run them through the IM Cleaner Clamp V2 and into the cooled Brass Knurl Inserts. Loading a Scotch Bright Pad: Most likely you will need to cut about 1/4 off the end of the pad, but you should do a dry run just to make sure. The easiest way to load a scotch bright pad is to make sure the screws are fully extended and just holding on by a few threads (gives you plenty of room to insert the pad). Then insert the scotch bright pad all the way into one side of the clamp. Using the clamp press down hard (with your fingers), trapping the one side of the pad while tightly wrapping it around the body. Rub each corner to help the body crease into the pad. Then release the clamp a little bit and then push the other side in between the clamp and body. Once the pad is fully inserted and tight, screw down the clamp screws to secure everything. I will try and upload a video of the process in the future.",41946,RJ_Make

My plywood version was super light and very strong.

You should be able to download the STL files and modify them, such as adding custom air vents on top or on the side.

However, starting today none of my designs on this or any other platform will be free beacuse we are failing to see that to be able to make these, the designer needs to learn and master a lot of skills, investing time, money and effort. We must understand this as a business and that we need to support the platforms that make these files available to us. Making something that has some worth to it, costs dearly.
If you like it and works like intended then you are receiving value, you shouldto pay for it!
