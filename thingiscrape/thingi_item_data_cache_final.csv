0,2,MakerBot Screwdriver,"It's a small screwdriver, extruded as a single piece. Probably no good for heavy jobs, but still handy (Did you know that the Phillips-head screwdriver was named after the legendary Crafty King Phillip of ancient times, whose sons went on to invent the bandsaw and the pre-sliced banana? Although, now that you look, this screwdriver is a Flathead. Never mind.) ",replicator
0,3,MakerBot Plate,"It's an oblong sheet, about four inches long, slightly flared at the ends. You're not sure what its purpose is. One face is decorated with strange ridges, and the whole is pierced by several square holes, irregularly placed Attractive, though, isn't it? Sort of like a butterfly. ",replicator

The slot sizes are appropriate for ""172"" illustration board, but you can scale the pieces to construct this model out of other materials You'll need to cut 60 large triangles and 90 small tabs, as detailed by the text in the file.  Assembly is straightforward; refer to the pictures for details. ",phooky
0,8,MakerBot Knob,"This is a small, slightly blocky knob, rather like a faucet knob. It has three flanges, no doubt to offer a better grip. In the center of the knob is a small pentagonal hole Will be very useful if you have a small pentagonal water faucet! ",replicator

0,17,Flatpack Bunny,"I created this bunny to be lasercut out of 1/8th inch white acrylic. It's a bunny that can hold a flower or a baby bunny!Embedded in it's head is a stopwatch, you can leave it in it's head or take it out and make a little necklace for the bunny Gently rock all the pieces back and forth to free them from their plastic prison. Then assemble them!Photo by http://leahpellegrini.etsy.com. ",bre
0,18,Flatpack Monkey,"This is the first of my flatpack action figures. I've made lots of prototypes so that the tolerances are really tight and they basically snap together. If by chance you force it to much and it breaks, it is easy to fix it with a drop of superglue.The MK-1 is a monkey on a mission to defeat the evil kitten empire.With cymbals to clang and a knife and fork to eat with, the MK-1 is accessorized to make some noise and eat some dinner.A prehensile tail means that it can carry the accessories in it's tail too!One very special thing about this monkey is that you can hold it up to the light to see the skull inside it's head.These are not for small children because they have small parts that are rather sharp I made a comic book for instructions!  Download it below!Also watch Leah Pellegrini's awesome video. http://flickr.com/photos/leahpellegrini/2900496918/ ",bre

0,32,Laptop Stand with steampunk gear design,"The other day while hacking at NYC Resistor, I realized I was getting a crick in my neck sitting hunched over at my laptop. I needed some sort of laptop stand to get the screen up higher, and one that I could get my external keyboard under so my computer wasn't too far away. I'd never seen exactly what I was looking for, so I figured I'd whip one up!A little while later, with some help from Inkscape and our Lazzzor, I had this laptop stand.Because the stand is made from 3 flat pieces which you can take apart, it's extremely portable and light You'll need 2 of the larger ""arm"" piece, so don't forget to make a mirror of the top piece when you cut this design. ",ericskiff
0,34,Icosahedral radiolaria,"This is a ""radiolaria"" sculpture roughly modeled on the drawings of Ernst Haeckel.  It has simple icosahedral symmetry, with thirty ""spines"" radiating from the edges The slots have been designed to accept 1/8th inch acrylic.  The fit can be a little loose (not the least because acrylic sheet tends to have a little variation in thickness), so I recommend using some acrylic adhesive to hold it together when you're done.As with all acrylic sculptures, this will be a bit brittle when assembled; try not to drop it too far.  Mine is suspended from the ceiling. ",phooky

0,52,DIY iPhone stand...,"If you have an iPhone and watch long movies (usually from ripped DVDs) leaving the phone in the dock doesn't cut it, the iPhone needs to be horizontal. I usually have CNN, ABC or a few hours of news on my phone and like to leave it on my desk while I work but you can't watch these in the dock since it's turned the wrong way. Long plane / train trips with a tray made me want to make this too.So - here's an iPhone stand I made, you can take the file to a place like TechShop in SF or anywhere there's a high powered laser that can cut acrylic. Believe it or not there are lots of these lasers in most cities, definitely at a lot of campuses now too. Universal and Epilog are usually the only two brands you'll come across.I figured this is a good beginner project for getting starting with your own little ""FabLab"" like project. Variations on this model will work with other phones too, all depends on the size and dimensions of your phone of course.I made this stand as a snap-to-together / press fit and it can be reproduced cheap, if anyone designs a better version send me the file and I'll post it up here on MAKE. I put a hole on each leg so the USB cable could fit through, it seems to be a better way to hold the sync/power cable.Here we go... Get some acrylic, I bought a sheet of 12"" x 12"" clear acrylic (1/8th"" thickness). You can get these sheets at local plastic stores in most big cities or online - Link (McMaster-Carr $6.48). Cast (not extruded) tends to be more scratch resistant and better for projects like this.Download this file, it's an Adobe Illustrator file (black and white vector line art, included are other formats if needed) - Link (ZIP with AI//CDR/DXF). If you want to make a lot of these just copy and past the 2 shapes over and over instructions can be found here...http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2007/09/how_to_make_an_iphone_sta.html ",ptorrone

0,57,PASCSR,"The Polyalphabetic Substitution Cipher Slide Rule.  This is a slide rule to assist with the ciphering and deciphering of polyalphabetically enciphered messages.  With it, you can learn a bit about how slide rules work and a bit about crypto at the same time!  It also has some added features that let you begin exploring strong crypto You can make two PSRs out of one piece of 12""x12"" material.  There's no waste leftover with this design!The PSR is essentially three pieces, the slide, the body and the indicator.  The body consists of a top and bottom stator which cradle the slide.  The indicator goes on top of the body and slide.Glue the top row of letters (top stator) and the bottom row of numbers (bottom stator) to the body.  Then glue together the indicator.  The indicator should slide over the base.  VoilÃ !  Now get to ciphering!The PDF should help make things clearer. ",nickfarr

0,76,Forktastic,"I was really hankering for some Ramen while at NYC Resistor recently and no one had any utensils including chopsticks. So Phooky and I whipped up in a few minutes this basic design, Threw it into the Epilog Laser Etcher, where by the end of 5 minutes we had a working utensil I used 1/8"" acrylic because if it's any thinner it'll break under normal use. I would recommend breaking out a heat gun and making a slight curving bend on the tangs so your food won't slide off as easily. I would recommend using a 7"" by 4"" inch piece with some scrap left over. If positioned right you can make 2. ",Eric

You don't want it to drop a few Kg of plastic onto your machine! I recommend 240C for ABS and HDPE. Cut the support membrane out of the large hole in the housing with a penknife.Thread the barbs through a 608 skate bearing by crossing them over each other. Insert the locking piece and drop the bearing into the housing. Screw it into a ceiling joist.Note that the close up pictures show a three screw hole housing but the STL file has a two hole version more suitable for ceiling joists. ,nophead
