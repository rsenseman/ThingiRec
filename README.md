# ThingiRec by Robert Senseman  
##### Content-Based Recommendation System for thingiverse.com Users
***
Overview
-------
ThingiRec uses user data from [thingiverse.com](http://www.thingiverse.com) to recommend to users other users with whom they should connect and parts that they may be interested in building. [Thingiverse.com](http://www.thingiverse.com) is a 3D printing hobbyist website where users share their 3D-printed creations. User recommendations are made by *content-based filtering*, using the similarity of parts that the user of interest created and parts created by other users of the site. Maybe the folks at thingiverse.com will put this feature on the front page of their site soon; for now, the app can be used at [ThingiRec.xyz](http://www.thingirec.xyz)

The Process
------
The overall process of the project can be broken down into 4 steps. These steps will be detailed below:
1. Data Collection
2. Data Manipulation
3. App Creation/Code Refactoring
4. App Deployment

##### 1) Data Collection

An in-depth explanation of your process
What algorithms and techniques did you use?
How did you validate your results?
What interesting insights did you gain?



Code walk-through
Give an overview of what each section of your code does.
Make it clear to the reader of your repo how they should navigate your code.
If you have a particular bit of code you think is clever or where the meat of your work is, make sure to point it out. If you tell them what to look at, they will listen.



How to run on my own
Give instructions for how to run your code on their computer (e.g. Run python scraper.py to collect the data, then run...)
